"I would like to thank Brendan Bence for his careing ,prompt service he provided to my family and pet children this morning.
I must commend all the the service agents who assisted us in the past as well,sorry i did not get your names.We are 
very happy to be part of the Dotsure pet family and are happy to sing their praises to all animal lovers we come into contact with.",5
"Was great, followed up and helped with every question! 
Thanks for the great service!",5
"The service I have received throughout my active policy have been outstanding! So don't get me wrong, it's still a good provider. 

The reason for this bad review is because of the person I spoke to when I wanted to cancel my policy. Michael Borman kept trying to convince me to stay after I told him numerous times I'm only interested in canceling at the moment, I will think about returning at a later stage. 

He probably told me to ""be realistic"" no less than 4 times. So rude! Really.

When I do think about pet insurance again, Dotsure will not be on my list of options.",1
"Had the absolute best encounter with Dotsure.  Michelle Klaassen Greyling really took the time to understand and assist with my needs. She is really friendly, patient and helpful. Service overall is amazing and the pricing is tops! Really happy to have joined the family.",5
"Have only just signed up with Dotsure (pet insurance) but my experience with Gershwin Lewis has been great, he was very patient and available, answered all our questions, followed up timeously and made the sign up process easy. Also seems like a generally good human!",5
"I have had one of the worse expiriance with this insurance, I regrate ever taking in nd why did I continue with it for such a long time. I asked them to do a double debt on my account as I didn't want to have a month without insurance. They refused. What kind of an insurance is this. I will tell every1 on my instergram nd Facebook about them. This insurance is a scam people should never ever trust Dotsure car insurance.",1
"What a lovely experience dealing with Ayana Zulu from Dotsure. Friendly, so caring and she explained everything so well.",5

-5 stars if I could!!!! I have had the worst time with dotsure pet. They took forever with claim. I had to phone and find out what was going on 3 weeks after claim was sent to find out what was going on. Cancelled my insurance with them and had to listen to phone call for half an hour to do so. Eventually I was able to cancel and my dog has been sick recently still under dotsure as month has not ended and now do not have access to manage claims or get forms. Do Not Use Dotsure unreliable!,1

"I was very impressed with the first claim that was sent in for one of my puppies. Had great service, follow up calls, kept up to date about payments. But the second claim for my other puppy, I got an email back with a blank letter head, the body of the email read please find attached the information still needed or that is outstanding for the claim. Replying to that email got no response. Then got an email wishing my puppy well with recovery, logged onto the online portal just to find that they cancelled the claim. Phoning them also now frustrating as the Claims handler is not the person dealing with the claims but their email signature is on the emails sent out.",1

I was given a tax invoice from the dealership which is proof that the nudge bar was installed by the dealership and before i took up insurance . The accessor then asked me if i have a vechile inspection sheet. I explained to him that i was never asked to go and have my vehicle inspected and they need to pull out recording as my proof as well.

"I had a car insurance with Hollard,and they automatically transferd my policy to DOTSURE who just scammed me and added their 3 new policies to further deduct from me.I would like to warn everyone who has a policy with DOTSURE...."" RUN FOR YOUR LIFE WHILE YOU HAVE TIME ""
Right now I'm going back to Outsurance for my car insurance, I pay a little bit Xtra, but they are very good.Ive been with them for years, not even once they added what I did not ask.I wonder what Hollard saw in them, but as for me, I'm out...People..be warned: ..DOTSURE is definately "" NOT THE WAY TO GO.."" If you were handed over by Hollard,  look for another Insurance before they scam you..!",1
It been a nightmare if I knew better I would have not wasted my money paying for services that I wouldn't be able to utilize. Dotsure insurance failed me as they clients. My very first time claiming Dotsure disappointes me it tooked them 2 full months to get my car repaired.... I had to wait another 6 months for them to finalize the third-party claim and the fail to provide me with feedback I had to call them every 1 or 2 days a week. At the end they final conclusion was that I'm not getting my access amount because the money provided by the third party was not enough. Although the third party was at fault and has agreed on paying it just that dotsure insurance is keeping the money because the amount provided by the third party is not enough. They have failed in helping me as my insurance. And now they don't want me to take the matter to court. I hape sharing my experience would help someone before making a decision if I knew better I would have chosen a better insurance company even their access is sky high. I'm so disappointed in dotsure what a waste of money,1

Now I'm not even covered for a visit to the vet with a sick dog.
If you want to be taken advantage of and treated like your pet's excrement, then take out a policy with Dotsure. If you want to be treated fairly and be able to actually use the service you pay monthly for, take out pet insurance with another insurer.",1

"They have absolutely no compassion. They pretend they do but in same breath just want to postpone the claim till everything is over, which can take days or weeks. Will be weeks actually. 

Here is the story:
About 3 weeks back my car burned down next to the road, me and my brother in law where on our way to Springs when car started giving trouble.
Next thing we knew car was burning. 
There where alot of people on the scene, some even before it started burning. 
(The car was also in an accident like 3 months ago, but was fixed) 

The investigator was here in Gauteng from George and met up with my brother in law and did all questions and so on (obviously making you feel like you done it on purpose).
Now, I couldn't meet up that day, im in and put of hospitals as I have a very high risk pregnancy. 

Last week he said he will do the interview telephonicly as i am on bed rest. I was willing to meet a colleague that he said can meet me or do zoom.
Then he said they will rather do it over phone next day, just to get a call saying plans changed yet again and will now not do it that way but he will be here again this week. So we decided on today (Monday) after a squirrel about everything. As i really can't wait till everything is over to know the outcome. 

Unfortunately I ended up at hosp again, they are monitoring me and especially the baby as she had a few heart rate drops, so we are trying to keep her in as long as possible but have to watch that she doesn't goes into distress. 

Anyway,¬† I can't miss this interview so I said will try my best to make plan (bribe them) to let me go outside as nobody is allowed inside maternity ward or even try and discharge myself if I have to, knowing I'm taking a big risk. Well its not that easy to convince them but unfortunately insurance doesn't care, they still expect to do the meeting that way. 
They already complained at hosp that im on phone to much especially when im on machines for heart rate and so on. They are just going to postpone the whole claim that is already putting so much stress on me. I wanted to meet the colleague last week or even do zoom. Now im at a place where its xtra difficult and can be transferred to another hosp. 

Im really disappointed that people have that little remorse. 
The guy had been nice, trying that we do this meeting, its just that this could've been done last week of kept to the fact that a colleague could see me or phone me.

Im really at my wits end.",1

The reason I left is to go to a better insurer, which until now have proven to be the best move and the correct. Other insurer a lot more helpful, payouts on every claim which needs to be done!.

Great service form Marizel Bernardo. Quick and easy to get insurance for my fur kids,5
My dog has been with dotsure on the basic plan. He then developed cancer. I upgraded him to the superior plan. Now when I wanted to claim they said sorry they do not cover existing condition. They obviously knew about his condition as he was on the basic plan an now they don't cover his condition on the superior plan. I would not recommend Dotsure for pet insurance. They make empty promises. When it comes to out payment of claims they have a 1000 excuses.,1
I had insurance with them and after accident they never paid me. Worse i still have policy that i dnt want to carry on with because they debit whenever tgey want,1
"I signed up with Dotsure for cheaper insurance moving from Miway. This was a big mistake. The wole journey has cost me more before a month has even passed. I got debited twice  for products i did not agree to, my mony has not been returned since. I got so spammed in my mail box and had various consultants calling me for teh same thing that that i would have already provided.  The calls and emails are so ooomany but lead to NOWHERE.

Then they have this tracker that you need to be stuck with for three years..meaning you will be  stuck with dotsure for three yrs else if you leave ealrier  you are then forced to pay for the tracker or to go on a month to monthfor remaining months, They dont explain this in the beginning 

Dotsure is an expensive and time wasting experince honestly. Please just return the funds just as quick as you did when you incorrectly debited my account and please donot call me again  or email me a bunch of letters leading to nowhere without that being done.

Out of the bunch of letters, policy wanst eveninccluded so  i still had to log onto their website  to retrive my actual policy! whats the point?",1
Very professional and knowledgeable service was received by Nicky and I am happy with the company's profile and services,5

Alhoewel sy onder opleiding het sy my vrae baie goed beantwoord en het teruggekom met die wat sy nie dadelik kon antwoord nie.

My experience with Bianca Johnson was exceptional. She went above and beyond to let me know of all the various services and options your company has available for pet insurance.

"Today I was traveling from Cape Town to Port Elizabeth and my car broke down in Swellendam just after 12 afternoon.  So I called dotsure and the ladies that I spoke to quickly made the necessary arrangements.  So my car was going to be towed away to the nearest safe place and if I would've wanted it to be towed to my place in PE, I'm told that I would've been liable for some additional costs.  So I agreed to a safe place in Swellendam.  Within the process, they also organized a car because I qualified for a hired car.  

It took almost an hour for the tow truck to arrive as they were still looking for a car for me on the side.  So they towed my car and I was left on the side of the road waiting for the hired car with all my luggage.  After 2 hours, I was told they can't find a car in the entire Cape town, which I found to be ""Unbelievable"".  I was then offered the accommodation option.  I literally refused to sleep in Swellendam since I wanted to sleep at home as I had an event I was rushing to.  I then asked the lady ""what guarantees do you have in finding a car for me tomorrow if I sleep here""?  She replied, ""If you take the accommodation option then you won't be eligible for a car, you can only take one of the 2"".  I told her to keep looking for a car and I'll wait.  After 4 hours in Swellendam I went to hitchhike for anything that goes towards PE and remember that I'm carrying all the luggage that was in the car.  So I got a car to George since that's where the driver was going and of course, I had to pay him. 

I must say, all this time they keep on calling me to check on me and with the bit of bad news that they haven't found a car yet.  I told them to look for a car in George since I'm heading there and the response was the same - NO CARS.  The entire George and the airport had no cars.  I mean they could've looked for cars in PE while I'm on the way to George.  So the driver dropped me off in George at a hiking spot near Thembalethu township.  I was called again and I confirmed that I was in George and still hoping to get a hired car and was told NO CARS.

As I was busy hitchhiking in George@ 19:30 I decided it was getting late and the township is 30 minutes away and so I called and told them that I'll opt for the accommodation but I needed to reach the township first in case there is a B & B nearby since I was told to look for it myself.  I asked her "" Are you not supposed to look and book the nearest accommodation for me""  answer was NO, I have to do it myself.  How do I do all of that in the situation that I'm already in? On top of that, I need to find accommodation that costs not more than R320 and I need to pay for it myself as I'll be refunded.  So with all the sweat, tiredness, I still needed to look for a B&B as they can't use their internet to search and so I took my heavy luggage and started walking towards the township.   I got there at about 19:55 and since I don't know George I had to ask around for the nearest B&B and there was none other than in town.   20:00 Loadshedding kicks in and the entire township is totally dark and there I was with all those bags and on my phone searching for a B&B.  After 8, there are no taxis available and so I had to find UBER since I found a B&B in town for R500.  

Got to the B&B and I paid.  Since I was hungry and tired, went up in York street to find a restaurant and BOOM dotsure offices in York street about 300 metres from where I'm staying.  So I'm thinking - Do they know any accommodation here for R320?  Since I was stranded in George where they are based, isn't there anything they could've done better?  Don't they have car hire services contracted to them?

Tomorrow I need to take my bags and go look for a taxi to PE and obviously, I'll have to pay R200 - R300.  What if I didn't have money with me?üò•

Let me leave my ordeal thereüò™",3
Unethical.,1
"Debited on the incorrect date. Bank charges incurred. I request a manager on 2 occasions. No call. I request a link for payment, no link was sent. 2nd attempt debit order without communication, bank charges incurred again. What needs to happen to be called by a manager as agents refuse to understand or accept what I have explained?  I can share the dates of the calls for you to pull the phone calls. I am advised that managers cant take a call as they are in a meeting!!!!!",1

"Be very careful when doing an enquiry with this company.  One of their consultants phone us when we enquire about pet insurance.  The consultant keep on talking and just wanted to sign us up.  We told her no we only want info first.  She asked our details and banking details,  saying that when we. Decided then she has our detail on file.  We told a to send us documentation to look at then we will decide if we will take insurance.  Yesterday a installment went off our account without us giving any permission to do so.  This is fraud.  So please be careful when dealing with this sly company",1

"Disgustingly Poor Service!
One of their consultants came back to me and said they can't get hold of me. My phone has never been off and there was no notification that said anyone tried to call me. I sent two emails to Jason Lovell and I still haven't received any responses. After I receive my money back I am finding an alternative because at this stage anything would be better. I would even pay a bit more just to get peace of mind that at the end of the month I won't have to fight to get my own money back. Definitely the worst I have ever experienced from an insurance company!!! Sies!",1
"I found all the information was given to me in a clear way so that I could understand. Kate Heigan is the reason I decided to go with dotsure. She was informative, bussiness like, friendly, interactive and when I asked for her to call me back because it was a bad time, she did.   Really good to know that if I ever have a problem in the future she will be the level head to help me through the process.",5

"Chad was incredibly helpful and guided me through everything clearly. He was also patient with me missing phone calls or asking him to call me back, and he never neglected to call me back when he promised he would. Compared to a larger insurance company that did not come through on the same promised, it truly impressed me that Dotsure and their employees were so professional and thoughtful. They also have excellent prices compared to other companies and gave me a discount because I had multiple animals. They did not try to convince me to get more expensive packages and I felt like they were looking out for my needs and not their pockets. I would certainly recommend them to anyone who is looking to get medical insurance for their pets.",5

"I was previously with Hollard before we were moved to Dotsure during 2021. 2 days ago, I lodged a claim for lost car keys and my claim was rejected as I was told that lost keys are not covered under my policy. When motor happy moved us to dotsure, I was assured that anything that is related to my cover will not be altered only to find that in their policy wording, dotsure removed a part where its states ""loss"" under a section of what is covered under car keys. I am so disappointed with dotsure. How possible is that only damaged or stolen keys are covered?",1
The sales agent assisting me was patient and listened to my needs and requirements. She went on to explain the benefits of the policy. I was thoroughly impressed.  Thank you Charlize for your amazing service.,5

"I have not experienced customer service like I did the past few days. Bernadine, thank you very much for your patience and help over the last few days. It was great working with you.",5
This is my second review on this company their worker Alize is simply not responding to my calls and they not sticking to their deadlines. It's been 4 months now that my car is broken and I have to take my son to school like that. They keep giving deadlines that they don't meet. They told me my funds will be available within 30 working days but the 30 working days have passed already and I got no money and no response whatsoever from anymore.. I am really so ****in tired of this company.,1
Khadija Khan assisted me. She was very pleasant and not driving a hard sales pitch. Very honest and explained all the products well and called or emailed as promised. I would give her 5 for my dealings but the call centre phone quality was not good on her side. I could hear clearly. Hope my future dealings are as pleasant.,4
"Bernadine made our pet insurance journey a breeze. Being willing to go the extra mile to answer all my questions and even call my husband to explain, as I knew she would do best! We feel safe knowing she has got us covered",5
Very professional and make sure that I explain the policy,5

"We hit a pothole which damaged two of our tyers. This was last week Tuesday 26. We have had no assistance from them. We have been moved from pillar to post. We phoned them to ask them for assistance, and no one can give me a definitive answer as to what to do. We have no car, we have two wheels that are broken, split in half and no  one is able to help. We have asked for Team leads, managers, assessors and seemingly no one is available to assist. This is the epitome of bad service. I am going to be changing our insurance.",1
"I am baffled at why Dotsure is receiving such great reviews, my experience with this company contradicts the positive reviews it's receiving. DotSure have on many occasions taken double the amounts that they should have taken and I had to make contact with them spending a lot of airtime because getting in touch with them is no easy feat. And after battles upon battles, I have to fight to make my case. I have sent an email and the 0861 number isn't working it says that the number is not in service. Please assist me by calling me you again took more money from me than you were supposed to. This is urgent as I am just about fed up with this nonsense.",1
"thank you so much to Nkosinanthi your assistance is very much appreciated keep up and continue to serve the clients as you did with me.

"Dotsure is the worst car insurance company in South Africa. On 24 December 2021 my car was standing in a parking lot from 15h00 until 23h00. In the time it was standing there a man bumper my car my son inlaw (he was going to drive the car home) was standing outside saw the whole thing happen. 
We phoned road side assist. Very impressed because they responded very quickly. 
The police wasn't on the scene because there were no injuries an they were on their way to a accidents scene where 4 people did not make it.
We went to the police station every thing was closed so we went on 26 December 2021 because we didn't have transportation on Christmas day.  
We contacted them 28 December 2021 
Long story short they sent us a document request I asked no questions I sent them the trip sheet from tracker, the instruction certificate from tracker, MY BANK STATEMENT the case number.
So there were on going phone call and from day 1 they were looking for a reason not to repair my vehicle. 
After sending them all the required documents they wanted to interview everyone there. They spoke to everyone we had contact number for.
Then they wanted my bank statement again not the one I sent in December not prood of payment that their debit order went my bank statement for January.
So we had a vew word exchanges I lost my temper at times but 27 January 2022 I sent them my bank statement.
28 January 2022 I emailed to confirm if they received it 29 January 2022 I phoned to hear if they received it but sa usual Zhaun-Mar√© wasn't available she will phone me back. (Poor lady sorry I was rude at times) She did not phone me back she sent me a claim cancelation letter and thats it.
For more than a month my car has been standing at the pannel beaters gathering dust not even touched and now they want me to go and fetch it because someone did not read their email. Thats only the begging. 
So please learn out of my mistakes these people take your money every month money you worked for but as soon as they have to give back they make you feel like a criminal and why do they need the January statement I still don't have an answer to that question",1
The worst insurance one can ever have.the service its very poor .They do not care about their customers PERIOD,1

Waseem Essac was such an exceptional agent.,5
Charlize Minnaar provided an  exceptional service üòä,5
I will never ever ever again use dotsure or even recommend them to anyone because they fail to make their clients happy by keeping up with their promise's why pay your hard earned money when they won't deliver and leave you in debt because now I am praying for a vehicle that is written off yet I had a comprehensive insurance cover plus too the credit shortfall cover but I am still paying for what it's really unfair,1
"I was more than happy with the consultant Ayana Zulu. She called me so many time's as I was always busy but she never gave up. She made me understand the policy, explained every level in detail and was really a pleasure talking to someone who knows her products  .
She was friendly and easy to talk to. Never did she force the policy on me, gave me options that didn't benefit her in any way.  I most certainly recommend her to my colleagues.",5

"All three my pets are insured through Dotsure and I have been extremely happy with their service. This month was the first time that I had to claim when my cat was diagnosed with cancer and subsequently had to be euthanized.

Submitting my claims on the website was a painless process and I received feedback about payments within a day. Most of what I claimed was covered in full. My policy was also updated instantly when I asked them to take my deceased cat off the policy. 

Losing a pet is extremely traumatic and I am grateful that Dotsure has made the claim process so simple, so I can focus on grieving for my beloved kitty.",5

He really gave me good recommendations and multiple options, I opted to downgrade per his suggestion and he suggested other options, if I can‚Äôt cope even with the downgraded plan. I was very pleased and impressed to communicate with him about all of the above. Thank you for your recommendations, understanding, and well wishes Michael :)",5

After going back and forth for over 10 weeks and then being told of the low payment amount , which I disputed....I am clearly now being pushed aside or just forgotten.  I have 5 cars insured with Nedbank Insurance and what a breath of fresh air they are.. I guess I will just keep waiting for Dotsure until someone wakes up and resolves this claim.",1

"Kadhija 

Was very professional and a wonderful person to talk to . I will highly recommend this process",5
"Trying to get home and car insurance through Dotsure has got to be the worst experience one could ever imagine.
Firstly, I get given a premium based on a zero excess for the car by Lu-Verne Samuels, who took down the application.
I informed her of all the details she required, including the home contents etc.
When I received the policy document, there was an excess of R 6 500 for the car, and the description of the premises was wrong.
Her tone was condescending, questioning me after every response with ""Do you understand?"", When I responded ""yes"", her answer was ""Good"". Where is my lollipop for being a good boy and saying that I understood? If you want to treat your potential customers like they are stupid, then she gets the award for succeeding in doing just that.
Then I had to send in proof of prior cover, which I did. This covered a period of 18 months, the balance of the cover was with Hollard, who are involved with, or own Dotsure. I informed the agent named Lindisipho Qaqawe that the records could be obtained from Hollard as they are ""one and the same"". I was informed that I had to do this, as there were no records.
Then after correcting the errors on the policy (like a corrugated iron roof to a cement/concrete roof), yet again the premium goes up. 
I don't think that Dotsure know what they are doing. 
They expect their potential customers to jump through hoops, while treating them like they are rather ignorant or stupid.
My advice, go anywhere else. You don't know what will happen in the event of a claim.",1
"We often rate businesses by interpreting the combination of their products/service/solution experience and sales personnel experience as a single service capability, despite them being fundamentally different business functions.   I am a new subscriber to dotsure insurance, and thus cannot comment on its product value or experience yet. I can however, without uncer*****y, express my appreciation for Tristin Smut's professionalism, telephonic manner and willingness to describe any points of clarification that I needed in thorough detail. Accordingly, I rate his sales service as excellent !",5

"Jean Boshoff has blown me away. Being in Marketing and Sales myself, I can truly commend her on the professionalism she displayed when calling. I would usually shudder and think twice of taking a call from any marketing/call centre. The best I have ever experienced. Jean is a great asset to Dot Sure.

"This is still not resolved! We are still awaiting payment. The whole process started 17 Nov 2021 it took dotsure 2 weeks just to send documentation for us to fill in. The quote for the damage was adapted from R31 000.00 to +-R18 000.00 a huge difference. This was decided by looking at photos which to me looks more like a money saving procedure instead of actually helping. Their assessor decided by only looking at photos that the damage is not as bad as what more than one panel beater said it was, in more than 2 months time not one assessor was sent to look at the damage, this was all decided while sitting and looking at photos. So they adapted a quote from one of the panel beaters and sent it to us. I phoned the panel beater to see if they would do the work for the price, as Dotsure sent us a quote with the panel beaters name on with revised amounts on the panel beaters quote and the panel beater was not aware of this at the time I contacted them. We had to follow up as answers were giving 2 or more days after asking. This is just overall poor. Instead of using the opportunity to save as much money as you can you could of showcased how good you can be and maybe get new clients the total opposite has happened. I will never recommend dotsure to anyone, this could also be to the fact that the person we were dealing with, also took his time with getting back to us. There is no valid reason for why this should take so long.",1
I had a very friendly experience with Caitlyn Kelton. She helped me come up with a better solution for my two dogs. I understood everything she told me. And the call just went down smoothly. üå∏,5
I've only been with dotsure for over 3 months and they've already done more for me than I could've imagined.  I was assisted by Brendan Bence and the service was nothing but excellent.

Chuma Mooi was very helpful and patient. Very good service,5
Dotsure promised to pay me R50000 towards the credit shortfall but when it was time to pay they only paid R5700 not the promised amount I don't know why they do that is because I had a comprehensive insurance plan for my vehicle to avoid problems but now I find myself with problems because of dotsure who promise you one thing and give you another thing not the promised one if I knew I would have used another insurance company not dotsure it is clear that they only worried about their business not us the clients who is paying our hard earned money for nothing only waste of money and time other insurance companies pay the full amount to settle the amount owed to the bank not dotsure that is robbing us SA citizens,1

"Amazing, quick and informative help from Jeanre Joubert at dotsure. Simple process and done all through a phone call. Thank you for such amazing assistance!",5
"Extremely terrible service, the consultants dont even call you back. My car was booked for the second time with durban South Panel beaters as they damaged my car more than fixing the issue. They took my vehicle and gave me and unroadworthy car a tata indica 2002 model. The car was absolutely junk and i was forced to drive it. It only lasted over the weekend as the car warning light was flashing as i went to work this morning and the car kept jerking, amd the wipers and heat guage was not working. I called a guy by the name of shane to advise that the car warning light was on. He then arranged for the car to be towed. I called dotsure multiple times to advise what had happened and the trauma i went through and they did not arrange for a replacement vehicle and left me stranded in kingsmead until 4 o clock. After making over 100 calls to the insurance and panel beater they gave me back my vehicle without nothing being done. My car had a foul smell and there was sandpaper dust inside of my car. The guy named Robin did not call me back as i left many messages and told the consultants that it was urgent as i was stranded. I feel overwhelmed and sick by all this stress caused. I have my vehicle but nothing has been sorted out. I cant believe that dotusre runs such a crooky business and does not keep the client at the back of mind. The service delivery as terrible and no communication what so ever. I went to internal resolutions and still no satisfaction. Durban South Panel Beaters should be removed from the panel as they run an absolute joke of a business. Very unsatisfying service. Imagine i could have died in that car as it was unroadworthy. I plead for an investigation to be done on that car. Dotsure does not value peoples lives. Robin is the most untrustable and unrealiable person i have ever met i do not want to proceed in liason with him any further. Please look at the call logs and emails i have sent to him and determine who you have employed at your company as the communication is disgusting. I will not liase any further with Durban South Panel Beaters with regards to my vechile. I want my issues sorted out as soon as possible. As this issue has not been caused by me. I repeat myself when i say i do not want to deal with Robin nor DSP!",3
"Thank you, Jeanre

Jacqueline and I look forward to a purrfect relationship with Dotsure.",5

"I have mixed feelings about Dotsure and I almost want to blame to incompetency of the person who is assisting me. One Monday 17/01/2022 I logged a claim for accidental loss on two cellphones that are on my policy. I was asked to submit documents, I DID! I was then asked to submit an affidavit WHICH I DID and now I am told that I need to take a screenshot of my ICLOUD. This is another attempt to delay the claim process even further. I was more than patient with Jo Anna but the fact that one claims is settled and the other is still lingering makes no sense to me whatsoever. I work in this industry and have never heard of a TAT for a cellphone claim of more than 48hour, yet here we are on day 6 and still being sent from pillar to post.",1

I'm really Fed Up of now of this dotsure company what does a person has to really do now they are so not worried about their clients the only thing that they are worried about is money that's all so long as paying it's okay for them but when it's time for them to pay they will send from pillar to post with out any help I wonder if they do have any hearts you can't be playing with people who pay money in order for your business to continue running but if it's how you do business well then they is nothing I can do but remember there is God,1
Very kind and professional consultant. Impressed that she knows phonetic language (which a lot of consultants do not know). Doesn't speak Klingon though... :P Keep up the amazing job you do and hope you stay safe. Live Long And Prosper.,5

"I am so incredibly Disappointed in Dotsure. In the time I needed them the most...
My Jack Russel was bitten by a snake and landed in ICU and DIED at Onderstepoort which is R10000.00 per day. When opening the policy it's told that ALL accidents is covered.. but NOT explained that ONE vile of Antivenom is R2000.00 ... I've put through the claim of the Invoice of R22000.00 , but was told Dotsure will ONLY pay R5000.00 of the whole bill. Saying the there's a Limit of R6800.00 (BUT ONLY PAYS R5000.00)... I do understand that there's a limit... But I haven't claimed for him the WHOLE year of the R20000.00 of the Annual Limit ... Now my doggy is DEAD... Still they won't pay me out the R20000.00 . What is happening with the rest of my R20000.00 that I've paid for.... WHY CAN'T THEY PAY ME THE REST OF THE ANNUAL LIMIT seeing that Ammo won't be using it anymore
This is disgusting and terrible... It's NOW in times like this that we need companies like DOTSURE to step up and do EVERYTHING in their power to help in rare situations like this.",1

After my accident, it was really difficult to understand how a damaged door could lead to a write off of my well conditioned car.

My interactions with the other departments was just as pleasant. Liabilities, claims and even reception. 

Only draw back is that the claim process has taken 8 business days, going in for 9 days but that is understandable considering all the quotes and cheaper quotes that was needed for my vehicle and in order for it not be written off for simply a damaged door. 

Thank you Mr Maroney and to Dotsure.",5

I lodged a vehicle accident claim on the 17th of December 2021. They did not bother themselves with providing any updates and I've been the one calling them 3 times a day ever since.

Yesterday they told me (having called them repeatedly) that my car is a write-off. 

Today they just called to tell me they'll tow my car without any explanation or providing a wayforward. I'm frustrated and disappointed in them.

Why are insurance companies ripping us off daily. Why? Why can't they pay the amount they are willing to and give me my car.

p.s. DYK we cover prescribed medication up to a set limit on our Basic, Standard and Superior plans. This includes chronic medication. Remember though, that we don‚Äôt cover medication for pre-existing conditions.

Yet when calling them they state they don't not even if you are on the highest plan!

This has forced me to look elsewhere, just out of principal.",1

I have always had good service from dotsure with my pet claims.

Lu Vern Samuels was very help full and professional,5
"I understood and i had made peace with the fact that my motor vehicle claim was rejected. However i have a problem with 1. Your service provider netstar is whack. How does a tracking device fail twice within a period of 12 months and you still utilize their services? Today i am at a loss of about 220k. Because of a non functional tracker. I don't understand why i should pay for services where i am the one to do follow ups.  And no reminders whatsoever. The phrasing in the contract is also a problem . ""Incase of an incident"" vs accident. The tractor in one of the family cars has been giving problems since installation. Is this your scapegoat? To install non functional tractors devices on your customers cars knowing that one day they are a way to reject claims? Fine. Number 2. My claim wa rejected even before the car was assessed and for me to have access to when last the device was functional i had to go through and ombudsmen. Even with proof that within 12 months i was in contact with the tracking company regarding the trackers malfuntion which netstart never followed up on i was still rejected. Dotsure is a rip off.",5

If an example is needed on how to engage with customers I highly recommend Waseem Essack as a contact point.",5

I called again and it was confirmed it has been cancelled. Then I saw they debuted money from another bank account of mine w/o my approval once again. How many times do I have to cancel and how can I get my money back for something I NEVER signed up for? Dotsure is pure bull****! üò°üò°üò°,1

Thank you",5
"Just had the worst experience with Dotsure who I think are absolutely dishonest. I bought a policy imagining that if my pooches required an operation and anaethesia which can be very dangerous, they would be covered. Due to the small print they are not. Dishonest uncaring and misleading. I also bought their most expensive plan. Disgusted. I would like to speak to the managing Director David Roach. I wonder how many others have been misled like me. As an animal lover one wants to do one's best for ones animals but again one is sold a policy be an exuberant policy seller and unless one is a lawyer or in insurance one can get the raw end of the deal if you are not totally aware of the situation. Very angry and disappointed. Michael de Pinna.",1

"Caitlyn Kelton was simply awesome she is truly a 10 out of 10. Calm, professional and clued up on products. Week done to her",5

"So we put in our second claim for my 7 year old black lab, Duke and get disappointed again! 
He went in for an annual check up and his rabies booster shot and they come back with a request for clinical notes? They saw that he was previously treated for elbow dysplasia, although this was incidental and the vet marked that this visit had nothing to do with that on the claim form - just a check up and his booster shot.
Still, an arduous telephone call pressing various IVR buttons eventually gets you thru to a living, breathing person, not the claims administrator who put the wrong telephone number on her e-mail.
Person A cant help, puts you thru to Person B who covers pets, can't help, puts you thru to Person C who explains that:
A: Annual check ups and vax not covered on the ""Basic"" Plan.
B: They only paid 50% of the previous elbow claim on the ""Basic"" Plan.
C: No point in upgrading his plan for future elbow treatment as it was reported under the original ""Basic"" Plan.
I told them this sucks and said that it was akin to putting in a motor vehicle claim to be told they only pay 50%. And if you would like to upgrade to be told , no they will still only pay 50% of future repairs as the original problem was reported under the previous plan?
She confirmed this and I said we will cancel and write in to Hello Peter - thus this post.
A classic case of short term insurance happily taking your premiums for a couple of years ad then whoops! A claim! Well, err that's not covered, and we only pay 50% of that and tough ****, you shoulda read the fine print!
We've cancelled and I advise everyone on dotsure.rip off to upgrade from the ""Basic"" plan. They seemed quite pleased with the middle finger treatment too!",1
I was assisted by Natassia Fourie today with a cancelation and she was able to immediately and very seamlessly assist me with the cancelation. It made an already bad situation feel a little better. Great service from Natassia,5

They are in possession of the vehicle at the Springs site.  They did not take the keys with them from the Police impound and are threatening to cancel the claim because of their incompetence.  They DO NOT PHONE BACK, their call centre drops calls and this is the worst experience we had from any company....",1

"Not sure how dotsure.co.za is ranked #1 insurance company on hello Peter when they debit my account as they please.

Ever since I've been insured with Dotsure every week there's a debit order going off my account, when I was told I will only pay R222 for my insurance. 

Now they just take money from my account as they please, not sure if that's what makes them a good insurance company.",1
"Very friendly and easy to talk to agent , really had a good conversation",5

Thanks Sonja for your kind assistance üëå",5

"I have been debited R437 without my knowledge & approval of the policy of the policies with Dotsure. I was surprised to see a debit going through on the 31st Dec. i couldn't call them on the 1st Jan as they were closed. When I called Dotsure today, I had to wait for 30min before I get assistance. As advised by the broker, Sibusiso, an SMS was sent to me on the 10Dec, which only states the policy number and nothing about the debit order arrangement & amounts to be debited. No one called me to sell me extra products & i am so surprised to learn that a person by the name of Edwill Cloete sold me these products.. I am very upset & very disappointed at the service received and for my personal banking details being shared with a stranger who just approves debit order on behalf of the clients.",1
Great service. Followed up when they said they would. Marizul was a big help.,5
excellent service from Amber Bird,5
"I'm so sad that Hollard is no longer handling my pet insurance. 

I submitted a claim of close to R8000. I'll get back around R4100 as per the payment advice. 

The amount claimed is not R6223.20 as per your claims advice. 
My first invoice totals R993. The second totals R6836.20. I am claiming R7829.20 in total. 

Medicine you specify at R88.50. But the medicine specified on the invoices totals much more than that. Where did you get that amount from?

Please specify what OTHER means on your payment breakdown?

This payment breakdown and amount that I'll receive back is extremely disappointing and I'm very unhappy with this. The service was far better with Hollard. 

I was told that you don't pay for the anxiety medicine given, but even with excluding that amount, the amount claimed and medicine still doesn't add up. Your call centre agent was also very unhelpful. And in her email, just said anxiety meds aren't covered. That doesn't answer my questions of why I'm getting so little from my claim and that my amount claimed is higher than on your payment breakdown. 
Very, very disappointing.",1
The representative Kate Heigan was very helpful and friendly. She made sure that I understood everything fully. Cover is immediate making the policy really accessible.,5

"I have recently signed up with Dotsure.
I thought my premiums would be around R600 (As I understood I agreed to).
When my account was debited the first time, there were a whole lot of extra debits for various things. I thought these were only one-time debits. But then this month, besides being debited R600, Dotsure took off an extra R740 for (what turned out to be) extras that I had evidently/apparently ""agreed"" to paying, verbally. 
I phoned up Dotsure and cancelled all these ""extras"". 
I am really angry about this manipulation with the use of telephonic, verbal ""agreements"" This is not right. 
Dotsure's boast is that they want fans, not customers. 
Well, they may have a ""customer"" in me, but they just lost a fan. 
Let's see if the management is serious about re-winning me as a fan!?",1
"Excellent service with consultant Mazibuyo. üôåüèΩüôåüèΩHe was thorough, explained every detail. Well done n keep up the great service üôåüèΩ",5
There's a policy which was opened fraudulently using my details. I have canceled this policy but you still went to my account and tried to debit. Why? Now I have bank charges because the debit order bounced. Absolute BS.,1
Good,5
"Great service received from Gershwin. He explained the different options clearly to me. I'm grate full, thank you Gershwin",5
Useless insurance company full of lies they said they were going to get back to me but nothing from last year till now I'm still waiting for their call,1
"I was referred by a friend to apply for dotsure for my two kittens and was contacted by Jeanre. She was so sweet and patient, with a great friendly spirit and a smile in her voice. Honestly, it was such a pleasure to work with her off of that alone but she was also extremely thorough with her explanations and very professional. Great introduction to the dotsure family. Thank you Jeanre!!!! üåª‚ú®",5
"Deductions from account without permission. Cancelled insurance with oakhurst and tracking with netstar.
 Had 3 year contract with netstar vehicle sold after 5 years ,informed dotsure and got acknowledged via e-mail of cancellation.
 
 If deductions persist legal action will be taken if proof of signed contract for renewal of netstar services can not be provided by company. 
 
 This seems to be the only way we can contact badger admin or netstar.

"I had the pleasure of dealing with Charlize Minnaar, who was friendly and informative. She answered all of my questions with ease and took the time to explain and re-explain all my queries. It was an overall good experience and I wouldn't mind recommending dotsure to anyone",5
"Not even one star. Pet insurance taken out 2013 and have continued cover of Paddington following adoption in 2010. The reasoning behind implementing cover  for him was based on as a ‚Äúrescue‚Äù from SPCA, he had been ill treated and couldn‚Äôt predict what health issues lie ahead. Since then, he had pain tablets some time ago for a sprain. Very little else,  if at all. Paddington has been in remarkable health. In October, he started limping, the medication was covered. Since, then the nightmare begun, DOTSURE, has been abhorrent in their dealings, utterly uncaring and incompetent. Worst fear in November,  Paddington was diagnosed with osteosarcoma and needed amputation. Out of respect, I advised Dotsure of potential claims. Despite all documentation being submitted, including claim form and invoice/s from a registered veterinary services at Onderstepooort.. I was repeatedly asked to resubmit. How appalling? Despite documentation being submitted in time. An email, the previous evening confirmed the file was closed. En route to amputation. I was called again, apologizing for their neglect. she said all was in order and she could see documents had been received. Their utter  negligent behaviour has caused endless stress since then. SMS‚Äôs, emails, calls, at times I would be asked to start from scratch to explain why I was unhappy. Or rate their service on how I was helped, what a joke? I sent email desperately asking this matter be referred to senior executive level. Mr Roach as an example. They are often too lazy to read file. It is a tick box exercise, incompetency reigns, despite asking for management to intervene it takes days and days to get a response. Paying since 2013, just when I needed the cover, it has been such a bad experience that regardless of the costs I am in for, I cancelled the cover, with them yesterday, just to stop this stream of depressing, incessant inefficient admin calls.pretending to be caring for both the pet and owner.",1
Great service and great help from Charlize Minaar,5
It was great thank you. Charlize minaar explained everything well to me. I'm grateful thanks,5

He is friendly, professional, extremely helpful and has a great sense of humour.

I asked him to please give me a call two days later, which he did and I signed up with Dotsure pet insurance.

"Not even one star worth of their service. Bought a new car which needs to be registered in 2022 the amount of calls to an extend where I was about to cancel my insurance and the tracking device. The premiums are low and you get caught with a 3 year contract for the Netstar device.

Low premiums = Low customer Service = Customers patience to being lost have not dealt with such incompetent people in a long time.

"My dog has been vomiting intensely over the past few days and Dotsure refuses to cover the cost of his vet consultation and medical prescription, dismissing it as a ""behavioural problem"".

"I am furious with this place! After numerous calls and motivations, today after my dog's operation, they want to come back to me and tell me they paying for nothing. Four different consultants from Sasha to Janelle who ALL GIVE DIFFERENT VERSIONS. I am tired of repeating myself.  They pay for the treatment of a bad eye, but won't pay for the operation. I downgrade effective January and they have done it effective immediately! Now my dog is not covered and NOBODY IS PREPARED TO LISTEN TO VOICE RECORDINGS. They tell me to motivate a hernia operation and now they say they won't cover it. WHY TELL ME TO MOTIVATE IT THEN? CAN ANYONE HELP?",1

"I joined Dotsure in 2017 and never had a problem until recently. Towards the end of 2021, I was not getting payment breakdowns and I had to call and follow up. For the last 2 claims I was out of the country and I mentioned the new cell number to call me on, in the email. They tried calling me on the south african number (which was off) and then sent an email asking for medical history. I responded on email with the medical history. They sent another email asking for medical history AGAIN to which I responded. They automatically cancelled the claim. It seems that they dont read the emails. I came back to SA and called me to lodge a complaint. The manager called me and stated that a consultant will call me. No call received - I had to follow up. A consultant eventually called and told me that the one claim is a follow up on another claim which was incorrect. She said she will call me back in 5 minutes. She did not. She sends me an email (still trying to resolve an issue on email). I am very disappointed in Dotsure. Their service went downhill and I still have no feedback on the very last claim I submitted. Seems they dont have the correct skilled people or they are under resourced. Pretty disappointing and bad service.",3

they quoted me for R1600 on 2011 mini which I dint have a problem with, my problems started with their debited amounts, I was told they will deduct a prorata and was surprised to see a debit order of R1866 and two small amounts for the excess and the platinum insurance for R211 each, which I then later cancelled the (plat insurance).
as I was expecting to see the monthly debit order of R1497 on the 21 of December I was again hit by another surprise when they deducted the so called dotsure fee of R950 and the excess fee of R211 which i agreed on.
my worry is that in a period of less than 30 days I paid almost R5000 which is almost double amount I'm paying for the car.
people should play very very far from this insurance Co if they really value their hard earned money.
I'm asking myself how much will I pay in January as these guys are doing as they please with my bank account.",1
Very friendly and professional.   She   was also very knowledgeable.   I was very impressed,5

"I got involved in an accident within six months of joing Dotsure insurance. From the day I logged my claim I received an excellent customer service from Amanda Nyakaza, May you do unto others what you have done to me.

Thanks a million times",5
I was assisted by Brendan Bence what a complete pleasure my request was dealt with quickly and efficiently in the most friendly and professional manner fantastic service once again well done and thank you,5
"I was assisted by Kelly Kengne and was absolutely pleased with the overall experience. Kelly was nice and friendly and spoke in clear terms and I understood everything throughout the process. 

I was given suitable options and could choose what fitted my budget and needs. Dotsure has offerings that I find will be very difficult to beat by any other insurance company I have dealt with to date.

For Dotsure as a company I have one suggestion, and that is to make it clear from the beginning that there will be an activation fee, and not keep this unbeknownst  until the end of the call.

I am now proudly a client of Dotsure and look forward to dealing with them.",5
Service was highly efficient and informative about the policy taken.,4
Mieke was great assistance and helped me get the best cover for my baby,5
After being persuaded by my current pet insurer I requested to cancel my policy scheduled with Dotsure. Michael Borman handled the call and was very polite and helpful.

Quick turnaround time and follow ups as my pet is also insured with Dotsure",5
Great service from Gabriella.  Very easy to get pet insurance.,5
"We were involved in an accident whereby a pedestrian jumped in front of our car. The car was damaged. My husband and I are not happy with the service received from dotsure.
1. Dotsure tells us that our excess will go from R3000 to R7000 because there was no 3rd party involved. I asked them to explain the logic behind that. I believe if there is a 3rd party involved, there are more costs involved and it would make sense for the excess to be high. But the person bumped my car and I have to bear the high costs of the excess fee. The lady I spoke to explained to me that if there is no 3rd party involved, it's impossible for them to claim the excess fee from the pedestrian who bumped our car. When there is a 3rd party involved, it's possible for them to claim the excess from the 3rd party. However, on my 1st accident with the 3rd party no excess was claimed back from the 3rd party. This is just a contradiction and empty promise. On my 2nd accident, I had to make calls to the 3rd party to get the excess while my so-called insurance was doing nothing about the situation.

2. When I spoke to Ntombovuyo regarding how unhappy we are about the excess fee, she said she would forward us an email address so that we can escalate our complain to them. Instead we received a threatening email. The attached letter for Ntombovuyo stated that if we don't accept that they continue with the repairs in the next 7 days then they will no longer repair the damages to the vehicle. I responded to the email seeking an explanation but she never responded. I called requesting to speak to her but was told she was on another call. I then explained my situation to another lady but she deliberately hung up on me when she could not give me a proper explanation regarding the excess fee and the 7days letter. 

3. Ntombovuyo called to tell us that the cost of the damages to the car will be R18 000. I was not happy because the costs were based on the pictures that I sent. My car was not assessed. My 1st accident had minor damages but the costs were over R40 000. The current damages are more than the 1st accident but surprisingly the costs are far less. The 1st accident was assessed by the panel beaters to get the costs of fixing the car but now the costs were thumb sucked because no panel beater assessed the car.

4. The lady that I spoke to after Ntombovuyo said that she will give my contact number to management so that they can assist me regarding my complaint. When I asked her when should I expect their call, she said they will 1st have to evaluate how serious my concern is and that will determine if they will give me a call. I'm a paying client and I believe my concern should be attended to.

We had to hire a car because the courtesy car was removed from the insurance yet we pay a high fee. And now we have to pay an excess of R7000. Is there really any logic in that. On top of that I'm frustrated with the service that I received. This is not how a paying customer should be treated. On top of that, excess fee on my other insured has doubled and others tripled. I would never recommend dotsure insurance to anyone. I don't want to associate myself with dotsure ever again",1
They were patience and very friendly,5
"Let me give you some insight on this company. Big brand, quite popular and really good at putting up this image that they care. Unfortunately this is a power hungry, money hungry company that manipulates you into buying into their products.
That is all.
Make informed decisions people.",1

Dian Slabbert Was very helpful and clearly explained the policy,5
Dotsure full of empty promises they dont keep up with their promises,1
"Dotsure and so im still waiting on feedback,i will never recommend you to anyone,because with dotsure you can lie but what do a person expect ,seems like in South Africa you can get away with lying,cheating and anything.",1
Marizel Bernado was polite and professional.,5
I spoke to Kate Heigan and she explained the policy to me and offered me various options without forcing me to take a Korean expensive option. She was cheerful and informative and I really felt she was doing this because she enjoyed helping me make the best choice I could for my puppy Bella,5
"Heh cannot believe i got played by Dotsure. They run a bad business. So okay this is how my story goes. So after paying my 3rd premium with Dotsure Warranty plan cover i felt one of my cars i want to cancel the policy for. So i called them on the 2nd December to process the cancelation they did i was not refunded nor reverse the premium. Then on the 6th of December i asked them to reinstated my policy for the same car so they did. I asked them if will i still be covered for the December month because my last payment was for December was not refunded nor reversed to me, so legally i should still be covered for, so after consultant confirmed to her manager they came back and said yes you are still covered but they will require a pro rata payment of R350 i said ok cool. They debit the money and then bounced back so i emailed to say this money bounced back they said it will take 5 days to track it and come back to me. Then i told them i want to make a claim for my car they said okay they opened up the claim and kept sending me messages to assist with the claim by demanding and reminding me of certain document to submit to make this a smooth process. So i still asked the consultant that are you guys sure i am still covered raising the prorata issue they said we will be in contact with regards to that prorata and my claim will be processed as per normal should i send the documents, shouldnt worry. Sent the car to a Mechanic to have it done the bill was a whooping +R17 000 then i sent them everything as agreed and then i kept getting an SMS on updating about my claim and all this was awesome service i thought. Then a final SMS saying ""the interview process is done now the claim has been sent to the claims department"" then that consultant calls me thats where it took a left turn only to be told the claim is rejected based on the fact that i cancelled it and reinstated it later then i said then why was i told that i was still covered as per normal for this month because the premuim wasnt reversed or paid back to me and i only needed to pay the prorata which i kept telling you guys that it bounced back they kept on saying no i am not covered even if the prorata was paid it wasnt going to change much and sorry we cant assist you any further. So i said to her if you knew this all along then why did you allow me to continue looking like a fool wasting my time in getting all those documents only to be told fokol. 

I am not mad at all its just that i cannot deal with liars like this. I blame myself for trusting pet insurance to fix cars.",1

"a Lady that is insure through Dotsure hit my car on the 17th of November 2021. Two weeks later, I only received paperwork to fill in after numerous phone calls from myself and their client.

I received an email saying that my claim has been diarized for the 19th of January 2022, so now I have to drive around with a car with no side mirror and dented doors  for a month and we were in the process of selling my vehicle.

It's been an hour and m still waiting for assistance. If you don't believe me check ticket 0722 I've been waiting since 4.30 for assistance. Now m even thinking of asking someone to try and assist me since my insurance is always taking a chill pill when I need help but they always ontime for debit order. There is no app the AA app is Sooo not user friendly I just wonder if it's really worth it being with dotsure",1

"The worst experience ever received by Dotsure. I am actively looking for another insurance company. Had the disservice of dealing with agent Ms Barbie Fourie who seemed to be the most incompetent person I have ever dealt with.
I had lodged a claim for my home on the 23rd November 2021 for a leak in the roof. It is now the 13th December 2021 and I only received a final outcome from them now- Which is ""We can't help you"". ""Expenses to come out of your pocket""
They are SLOW in calling and providing feedback to claims and processes, I had to constantly call them for feedback. The had sent out different contractors to asses my roof with missing reports thus delaying my process. 
I had even sent 2 complaints to their legal department for assistance on how slow their agents are- but alas even that was not attended to.
I spoke to Barbie Fourie's supervisor- Benita from the household claims department and she did absolutely nothing. The whole company and staff are incompetent and customer satisfaction means nothing!

I Rate this company 0 . They do not even deserve a 1
Think wisely before joining DOTSURE from my personal experience.",1

I have signd a policy with dotsure where inception date was 7 oktober 2021 and debit order was 7 November.

The payment dit not go off the 7 off november for pro-rata and premium.Jade Hammond representative came to my business and asked me when wil i be able to make the payment after it did not go trough the 7 of November 2021 I made arrangements with Jade Hammond the representative of dotsure the 17 and the 18 November 2021 where she informed me i still have cover that i am waiting for payments to reflect asoon as it does i wil get the policy paid it was over a weekend the money reflected 22 November 2021 and made immediate payment. 22 November george had hard heavy rains and floods i experienced alot of damage and made contact with jade Hammond the representative she submitted me a claim form via email. On 23 November 2021 Jade Hammond called me from dotesure land line wich would have a recording At 8:15am telling me that i have no cover my policy was cancelled  and she is sorry she did not know. I had not received any written or call before that to inform me that the policy is not active and i have no cover if i was informed i would of gotten cover immediately. Jade Hammond had me under the impression that i was coverd up and till that point.

23 November Jade Hammond representative emailed me the claim form again and cc Ashley Watson here manager. I sent all fotos and videos to Jade and asked here if she can assist me with wat else is needed. I emailed Ashley Watson and Jade Hamilton a number of times to ask what is happening and do i still have cover and should i look for cover elswhere. 26 november 2021 Ashley Watson replayed and said i have no cover and would have to go through the normal process to get cover i have recived no contact from Jade Hammond nor Ashley Watson regarding my emails.

Benita Reeders claims department assistant manager contacted me and handeld my claim i gave here all the information she asked of me.

Today 8 December 2021 she came back to me and said my claim was denied. 

Jade Hammond had me under the impression that i was coverd under insurance 18 November 2021 she told me if i have any claims i must contact her. If i knew i had no cover i would had make sure to have gotten cover again by dotsure or seek else where if they did not want to assist me.

My business is closed from the 22 November 2021 up and till today 8 December 2021 because of busniss interruption. Dotsure did not do there part right and put me under the impression i had insurance.I have no insurance in place now of this situation.

Justin Jafta was very helpful and very professional. Great customer service,5
"Worst experience with an insurer. Spoke to 4 different people in just getting the claim approved. Approval based on pictures sent and not by a manufacturer suggested panel-beater who actually examined the car and found sensor damage.
The examined quote was ignored in approval and had to be submitted 3 times, finally to the call centre for someone to actually upload to the system.

Dotsure panel-beater fixes(given approval) and, who knew, sensor damage. Another round of approvals where I had to follow up personally and get approved - another week. 
Then another sensor gets highlighted. Another round of me calling and getting it approved - another week. Its like they don't follow their own processes. Panel beater has to call and get approval every single time unlike other insurance companies

Going on a month for something quoted a weeks work and still no car. Operators are very pleasant while little gets done without calling and pushing them every step of the way. I could be a claims coordinator at this stage. I hope they don't judge pet claims based on pictures...",1

"Switched over to Oakhurst Insurance after SANTAM and one of its ‚ÄúPlatinum Repairers‚Äù *****ed us over with a vehicle accident claim. Oakhurst was so professional and competent and their service delivery was brilliant. Since Oakhurst has become Dotsure the service delivery on claims is non-existent. 

We have filed several building claims for our home, the first one was rejected as Dotsure took the word of a service provider which we were expected to source ourselves and NO ASSESSOR was ever sent to verify the service providers feedback. The claim was rejected due to alleged lack of maintenance on our part which was in fact incorrect and we are able to prove the instances when we paid out of our own pocket for maintenance and repairs with numerous other service providers.

A week ago I filed another Building claim online for a severe roof leak after the heavy rains and hail storms in Johannesburg and to date, NO ONE has bothered even contacting us, the claim was cancelled without any explanation. We took out additional cover specifically so that Dotsure would send out their own service providers going forward however, once again, this is an insurance company that is happy to take a Clients money and not deliver any service. No assessor was sent out once again.

Now we have lightning damage to several of our major household appliances for which we submitted a claim online again a week ago. To date NO ONE has contacted us, in fact quiet the opposite, we received an email from the claims department telling us that we must call Dotsure regarding the claim. We have responded to that email and expressed our absolute disgust that Dotsure expects us as the Clients to call them to process the claim when they as our insurance service provider should be calling us as the Clients. It is not our responsibility to run after the insurer, the insurer should be running after its Clients. 

We then received an email response from Dotsure saying that my fianc√© / Policyholder is uncontactable and that they had tried repeatedly to contact him to no avail as they further allege that his phone is always off. This is an absolute lie and just laughable as we have checked and double checked again and there is not a single missed call from Dotsure and my fianc√©‚Äôs phone is NEVER off. We even called his phone off several different phone numbers belonging to various friends and family and his phone rang every time! We have sent them my fianc√©‚Äôs alternative number and still no one has contacted him. Of course they will probably do what seems their latest norm and cancel the claim. 

In their ridiculous response to this they now tell us that they want to register the claim when we have ALREADY registered the claim ONLINE and have already received a claim number! The incompetence is actually just ridiculous! I think it‚Äôs time to change our insurer!",1
"I would like to write a review about dotsure.co.za  Marizel Bernardo provided A-class service.   Well done and thank you for being so patient, attentive and super helpful!   We really need more people like you in the industry!",5

I tried calling Dotsure and didn't get any response from them I called again today telling them my ignition was damaged and was told and underwritter was going to call me immediately and an hour afterwards I called and my call was dropped.  I then called some guys to come fix it so I can move it from the Lenasia Pound. I am extremely disappointed that the money that I pay them is not doing much for me (R1245) in premiums.
I would love to hear from you guys if could..",1

"I am with Dotsure Car insurance (previously called Oakhurst) over 13 years.  I never had any problems during this time.  But since they changed their name to Dotsure I am experiencing claim problems.  My vehicle has a dent om the bonnet caused by a severe storm and in result the roof of building and carport poles came down on several vehicles, at a Roadhouse in Hartbee****rt.  Two different quotes (dated 18-11-2021) from Auto Body repairers, was rejected because the quote amounts are more than R5000-00.  Dotsure accessor stated that the repairs must be calculated to their rates (under R5000-00).  But both the Auto Body Repairers said it is not possible to fix the car under R5000.  I have three vehicle policies with Dotsure and all three was rejected!",1

"I was scammed off and left with a huge vehicle bill of a written off vehicle. On the 24th of September I was hit and my vehicle written off. When I lodged a claim I was told that I exceeded 1000 Kms limit and therefore they are rejecting my vehicle insurance claim. I was not even provided with a break down of how and when I exceeded these kms. I am now left with the vehicle obligation of a written off vehicle while I thought I was Insured and sorted. If you are thinking of joining Dotsure, do think twice.",1
"Poor service from dotsure almost 2 weeks of not knowing where i stand with my claim busniss is standing still because i dont know what to do with the damage goods and broken masjiens not one person from dotsure has contacted me since the claim send this email and still not getting any response. 

Good Day Ashley

Trust you are doing very well

I am doing well, however very concerned about the fact that I am currently not insured and that my premium was refunded.  Again, I feel  I was done in gross injustice as I was not afforded the opportunity to reinstate my policy or find cover elsewhere, neither notified in writing that my policy was canceled.  Instead false information was provided to me via Jade that I still have cover.

Could you urgently & kindly advise the next step as to get this process started to activate or reinstate the policy soonest.  OR alternatively do you advise that I find cover somewhere else?  I dont know what to do and rely on your professional service & advise. 

The assessor paid a visit yesterday, 29 Nov & today, 30 Nov; could you also indicate the timeframe as to their final outcome.  I am sitting with damaged stock, not knowing where to go and what to do as your claims department does not give me sufficient info as to make an informed business decision.  If you cannot assist in your claims department, please provide me with a name & contact email so that I can follow up from my side as the communication process from Dotsure‚Äôs side is very poor and uninformed.  Do I get the opportunity to reinstate my policy with Dotsure?  Do I go find insurance somewhere else?  This is what insurance do, give their clients the best possible advise to make an informed decision. Up until today, I have not received this type of advice.

PLEASE, your kind attention and feedback will be greatly appreciated.

Kind Regards",1

I signed my dog up to Dotsure Medical Aid. I opted for the Basic Plan originally. I had fantastic service from Mazibulo Myo. I then decided I would like to upgrade to the Superior Plan specifically for the Hereditary conditions. I was told that I cannot claim on this plan for 12 months for any hereditary condition that might arise eg Hip Dysplasia etc. How ridiculous is this? I understand there is a waiting period but 12 months?? So Dotsure is happy to take my R430 but I cannot claim for any hereditary condition that might arise in the next 12 months? What is is the use of being on the Superior Plan then? I have cancelled my membership with Dotsure. I am extremely disappointed as I have always heard so much about Dotsure. Clearly there are many snags. Listen carefully to the Ts&Cs before joining.,2

"This Review is merely to thank Alisha Bouwers at Dotsure who took the time to understand my frustrations and help me with a solution.

you took less than 24 hours to contact me back with a solution that not only helps me but also helps the Company.

I wish that everybody has the heart and compassion that you have in order to assist people .

I do apologize for being erratic with you when it wasn't your fault.

but thank you so much for your kindness and I hope and Pray that your Employers know what a Gem you are.



i now patiently wait for my Vehicle.",4
my experience with them regarding claims is excellent.  their constant feedback regarding the claim is non to compare.  if all your documents as per their request is in order and your claim is valid there is no hassles or fuss as to the payments.  within three days your claim is paid into your account.  then it is your responsibility to fix your car etc. and what ever shortfall there is you have to pay that in.  therefore i recommend dotsure to anyone that is looking for a good insurance company.,5
Quick friendly and helpful,4
"Would highly recommend dotsure pet insurance.  Put  my  first claim in last Thursday,  no fuss, easy forms,  and the money was in my account 24 hours later, as they had promised.

I thank Rebecca for her Amazing Service and her prompt response and checking to see if I knew the terms and conditions and explaining the bonus features.

If all people were like you, there would be alot more business coming in for Dotsure. 

Thank you again for your help. It is really comforting to know all my flurries are covered in less than a few minutes. 

I will definitely refer Dotsure to friends and family and anyone I speak to about their fur babies and I will refer them to you Rebecca.

"I'm Not even sure as to how I feel at this point in time about Dotsure, yet alone the amount of time wasted trying to get my vehicle back , but I suppose I have to write a really compelling review and not sound utterly indifferent with the service I received since my claim is not fully completed.

for the amount  I pay on a monthly basis never in my life did I ever feel like I just want to unalive myself due to someone else's neglections  .

but to the few people that did try and assist in this unfortunate event  of me behind rear ended by someone who didn't bother to stick around or a towing company that took my vehicle without my permission and I'm liable for that.

thank you to 

Franciosi 
Mishca 
charne

and the others i forgot as i have already lost all hope and faith in the world of insurance.

"Just want to say how impressed I am with the Dotsure team and processes. I have been a client for a year or two now, but my 10 month old pup is a real terror and literally visits the vet once or twice a month. Just when I think Dotsure might be calling me to cancel my contract due to abuse lol- they are calling to ask me how my pup is and that the claim has been processed. Never waited longer than 3 days for payment. Love the little touches like the get well cards addressed to my pets. I can‚Äôt believe they have been able to keep up the same awesome level of service over the years. Doesn‚Äôt happen often. Would recommend them to all pet owners!",5

"Having been along standing client with Hollard a merger with Dot sure seen them take over my cover policy 
Since this my insurance has been nothing but a nightmare 
Firstly there premium increase was 17,5 % in a post covid economy where salary increase was only between 0 and 5 %
Calling them was not worth the effort was just told nothing we can do that‚Äôs the new premium 
Now today with no authorisation they move my fixed debit order that has been running every month on the 21st of every month to the 19th . Resulting in me having Rd debit order charge‚Äôs not to mention this will reflect on a person credit record as bad payer. 
And I shudder to think should something happen to me an my family over the weekend like home invasion where I had to pass away. How my wife and daughter would struggle with them rejecting claim given them the run around. And none of this my fault. But actually poor administration of a financial service provider .
Totally not compliant with TCF principles 
Borderline defamation of character saying I don‚Äôt pay my accounts. 
How on earth this company ever got a five star rating on this forum. Which they blatantly brag about on their online advertising I struggle to understand. 
This is definitely not an insurance company one would feel comfortable with 
As I said I did not join them out myself 
I originally had my policy with Hollard. And by acquisition ended up with the worst insurer    
And they must not even consider blaming a computer as someone loads and releases the debit order run 
Computers don‚Äôt think for them self",1
"Gershwin Lewis , a big thanks to Gershwin for great service and clear explanation. üëè I'm proud to part of the Dotsure family thanx Gershwin",5

"A Pet sales consultant  of Dot Sure, Mazibulo Myo helped me with my Pet Insurance. He did an excellent job! Thank  you so much Mazibulo!!",5
"I took up a warranty policy for my 2013 Chevrolet Captiva with Dotsure in March 2021. I was given a schedule of the policy covered and I accepted and signed up for it. Sometime in October, I drove into a pothole damaging the stabiliser arm/s and collapsing one of the shock absorbers.
I put in a claim with Dotsure and was asked to provide a quotation for the damages, which I did. The consultant I spoke to asked me to submit a damage report from the service centre together with the vehicle service history and I did.
She advised me that an assessor would call me for an interview. That did not happen instead I got a message advising me that the claim was declined. 
I went through the message together with the policy schedule and realised that I was sold a dummy. 
I, therefore, want to warn anyone who has this policy or wants to take it, to do that at their own risk to save themselves from this scam. For the past 9 months, I have been throwing R380 into a bottomless pit
My worst insurance experience ever",1

"Taken out insurance for my vehicle and at claim stage I was told by the assessor that my vehicle engine was damaged without any checks been done,Called several times requesting for feedback regarding my claim and still no feedback!
My vehicle was towed to pinetown to a panel shop were dotsure insurance does their assessments and inspection of the vehicles. Dean from the panel shop requested dotsure to send my vehicle to VW Agents because they are a panel shop and does not specialise in that field,Dotsure hasn't given him the go ahead.Assessor Mr Keith Moses from Dotsure stated that my engine was damaged without any checks been done and he stated that my interior carpets were dry after weeks they towed my vehicle to Jacobs Durban. My vehicle was left in an open yard were my car windows were left open which caused more damages to my vehicle as I went to view my vehicle in Jacobs my interior carpets,seats and steering wheel were soaking wet with water caused by the poor service and negligence of the insurance company! My car has dents on the body and the front bumper is damaged!

It's so heart breaking to see my car in this condition. Insurance is there to put me back in the same position prior to the event of something happening not put me in a worse situation!

Claim number:**********-0001",1
"i submitted a claim regarding my vehicle.  within 10 minutes of having received my claim the claim was attended to. feedback was given timeously  and my claim was settled in three days time. every step of the way i was given feedback. this is my second claim and my first claim was declined with valid reasons.

"Sales consultant, Jeanre Joubert made the process super easy for us and explained what was to offer in detail so that we can make the best-informed decision! We are very impressed with her service and glad we went with Dotsure!",5
I have tried to get help to release my vehicle that has been taken for fixing as it was under insurance with the Dotsure company. It is over 2 years now since I have been trying to track it down. I wrote a review a few months ago and they promised to do something about it but up until this day they are still giving me a hard time. 2 years!!!!!,1
"Dotsure Car insurance is the worst to deal with, especially if you are a 3rd Party claim!!!!

My son was reversed to by a Dotsure client on the 29th October 2021. He couldn't stop no matter how much he and other cars hooted for him to stop as the traffic was stationary and there were other stationary cars behind him so he couldn't reverse otherwise he could have bumped the car behind him.

Now here is the thing..... he admitted to the fault, put the claim through and everything, the problem is now with his insurance company (Dotsure) that is making everything an uphill battle to get it sorted. 
The car is parked at my son's friend's place in Sunningdale, Durban North (thank God because it would have been charging daily had it been stored elsewhere). 
It had to be towed there on the day of the accident. 
Dotsure wants 3 Quotes before they can process the whole case any further. The quotes cost a lot, the cheapest at R1000. Since my son is self employed and uses this car to get by where is he supposed to get about R4000 for quotes which we are told Dotsure might not use any?

The minute you mention Dotsure Car Repairs / Panel beaters are not interested because of Dotsure's bad reputation on dealing with claims.

All I'm saying is that if you are looking for a car insurance think carefully before being excited by Dotsure's cheap rates. I wouldn't have even known if they existed had it not been for this accident, however, their client was very honest and did everything on his part urgently and applaud him on that.

Before they ask for the case number when they want to defend themselves it's NYP**********-0001.

Thank you for the opportunity to make other people aware of such extremely atrocious service.",1
Zandile Klaas handled my claim fast and efficiently. She was extremely friendly and professional. I would like to thank her for her service and recommend Dotsure to anyone who is looking to ensure their pets.,5

Excellent service from Dotsure.  The consultant Abigail Barends was extremely efficient and professional,5
"On the 11th November 2021 at night, i was involved in an accident, i called Dotsure to notify them about my accident, the lady then told me if the car is drivable i can drive home and start with the claim process the following day. On the 12th i wens to PTA west SAPS for my accident report, i then called dotsure for the submitting process, i was then assisted by Zhaun Mare Fredericks who required all the documents and the photos for damages, after sending documents i had to call again asking if all documents were received, the very same day i received an e-mail requesting the same documents from Athenkosi Fuzani at 2:45, i then re-submitted again. Yesterday again i requested the status of my claim now i spoke to Thabo from assessment department, he requested more clear photos, i re-sent them again, now today is day 5 since the accident when calling to check the status of my claim i am told all the required documents are received except for the quote from the RMI approved supplier or dealer. On the other hand i am told that if i dont submit all the required documents on time before 7 days then my claim will be regarded as resolved.

Another interesting story is that, i have been with dotsure since 2019, i never claimed, today i am claiming and i get to know different stories, Zhaun mare told me that i am going to be liable to additional excesses for: having an accident after 22:00 R4000 additional for not having a witness to the accident and for not bumping in to another car another R4000 additional excess plus the basic excess of R4000, i then requested the recording which proves that the additional excesses were explained to me and until today i am still waiting.

So i am very broken by the treatment i received from this insurance its like they are buying time so that i wont be covered or i dont qualify to be covered but i qualify to pay my monthly premiums without any defaults.",1
"I was phoned by another insurance company earlier that day and only asked for a quote by the end of the conversation. Later, when I was phoned by Marizel from Dotsure, she had my attention from the get-go! I knew I was not walking away with just a quote here and signed up on the spot. Her manner was friendly, comfortable and professional. Definitely 5-star service.",5
"My home-contents insurance policy with Hollard was taken over by Dotsure this past year. On the annual renewal I got a notice that my premium was going up by 18%! I have not received a single clear answer as to the need for this huge increase despite over 5 emails and at least three phone calls. Some of my emails have not been responded to at all. Multiple promises have been made to call me back and I'm still waiting to get a decent answer since raising this issue first on the 18th October. 

Don't be fooled by an initial low premium if Dotsure are going to hike your premiums 18% yearly and not even offer any semblance of a reason.",1

"Amanda Nyakaza has given me awesome support, the fact that she gave me a call to follow up on the impact she saw through the tracker even before I called to log the claim that shows how Dotsure treat their clients with care.",5
"It was absolutely great, I felt as if I was having just a general conversation with a friend that had a positive outcome.",5
"Dotsure you are always begging me to write reviews so now I am. 
First you fail to cover my furbaby for procedure she may need &you won‚Äôt let me go on a higher plan which will cover the bad procedure.

And to top it off, you haven‚Äôt paid me the money you rightfully owe me on a claim that I received a payment breakdown for on Monday.

Chante Du Plooy was very professional and helpful. Will definitely recommend Dotsure.,5
"I had a very pleasant experience when submitting a claim.  Carlin Williams tried to contact me but failing to get hold of me, he followed up with e-mails.  The response was rapid and efficient and Dotsure gave me a clear breakdown of what they were covering.  My dog Gus even got a get well soon e-mail!",5
Tamara Naki was awesome very professional,4
"To be quite honest, this insurance sounded too good on the TV ad and even better when one of their agents called me on request. Fast forward to my first claim, my cat was extremely sick so I took him to the vet where he was diagnosed with feline leukaemia and they had to put him down cause he was suffering. Let me tell you when I say , out of the blue the topic of only paying out 50% of the claim came about, PLUS I won‚Äôt be getting a cent off the funeral cover since I buried my cat in my yard. I don‚Äôt know, I understand insurance but this is just a waste of my money. And a waste of my time. i do not recommend. I will find other alternatives",2
Had a great experience with Marizel Bernardo. She explained the policy in detail and was knowledgeable on all the questions posed to her. Well done!,5
"I had a conversation with Marizel Bernardo at Dotsure regarding possible cover for my new puppy.  She was very helpful, friendly and patient and answered all my questions, even sharing some experiences about her own pups.  When she wasn't sure about something she confirmed with her manager right away while I was on the line.  I appreciated the service given by Marizel.",5

It means a lot to me. Keep up the great work!!",5

"Don't be fooled. Easily the worst Insurance Company to deal with. Cheap and Willing when you sign on. However, I have been battling for three months now to cancel my insurance for cars sold a long time ago. We are being sent from pillar to post; the supervisor is always in a meeting. Worse, they never return any of the calls. I have to follow up every day, and the same excuses are given. Stay far away from them.",1
"Slow, incompetent service",1
"Amazing service from Alana Chothia
Very happy with the price and cover for my pets 
Thank you",5
Nothing to tell yet. Looking forward to have good experiences with Dotsure,5
I have been a customer of Dotsure since 2015 and so far I do not have any complaints. All claims that were submitted were approved without any issues and the workmanship provided by the service providers appointed by Dotsure was very good.  The customer service and affordable premiums for comprehensive cover with a tracker included has been worth every cent. Insurance companies have been calling me for car insurance quotes and so far I have rejected all the offers presented by well-known insurance companies because none of them have been able to match the package and affordable premium that Dotsure offers. I highly recommend Dotsure to all and so far I have successfully recommended two clients for them and one is pending. For that I was rewarded without hesitation or any excuses. I'm surely looking forward to the future and many more years of quality service and affordable premiums.,5
The consultant explained all i needed to know. He did a very good job and i was happy with the service,5
"I would like to express my sincere gratitude the level of service provided by Dotsure is one of the highest ever levels of service I have received.  Dealing yesterday with Tiola Smit was an absolute pleasure, helpful, friendly and service orientated thank you DOTSURE you are the best",5
I would like to say a very big thank you to Nomathemba Malgas for the way she assisted me with my claim. I was kept informed every step of the way. The claims process was quick and very efficient.,5

"Khadija helped me, she was really helpful",5
"I dealt with Samantha Armstrong at Dotsure for my claim last week.  The service was fast, friendly and efficient!  Thank you Samantha!  This is not my first claim with Dotsure and I have always received great service from them and extremely prompt payouts!",5

We would like to give her a 5 star review on her service‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê,5

"Bianca Johnson thank you for your outstanding service
You just made everything effortless and your kindness, warmth, friendliness and patience was so very appreciated
You are an absolute SUPERSTAR",5
i signed up with Dotsure pet insurance through the help of Michelle Klaassen Greyling. She made the process so easy and explained everything in detail. She went even further to answer all the questions i had and took the time to make sure i knew what i was signing up for. Really appriciate the great service i recieved and happy with my pet insurance.,5
"I can see that Dotsure is now trying to emulate the bad behaviour and service of other insurers who don‚Äôt want to pay out claims!

I have a car warranty with Dotsure and when I took out this policy, I was assured that all mechanical issues would be covered, the only difference in the options being the value of the cover. 

I had to replace the crankshaft in my car and when claiming from Dotsure, they are claiming that this part is not covered but it clearly states that this part is covered!!!!!

Also, I put in a claim for my central locking system that failed on my car, which I am told is not covered, so exactly what do you people cover????? I am really fed up with you insurance guys being quick to take our money, but when it comes time to pay out, there are many stories. The above needs to be rectified ASAP!",1
The consultant was extremely helpful and efficient.,5
Really really bad service ‚òπ ... i had the insurance for 5 months and was involved in an accident. It was clearly not my fault standing in traffic and being knocked from behind by a speeding drunk driver. First bad experience trying to report the accident and getting a tow truck. 2nd bad experience they do not ask what panel shop the car should go to. 3rd waiting a week for the assessor to advise claim being rejected for the car being sideswiped- meaning they are now adding additional eccesses to the claim without being informed of at the time of the insurance agreement nor through the whole process of the claim. This is really unfair for a excess for a claim to amount to R48000. This is almost half the market value of my car. 4th bad experience is trying to log a complaint. Always being promised callbacks but never received. Spoke to an assistant manager in claims dept and still no assistance. I have now being in contact with the ombudsman and just hope to get this resolved... really bad service and unfair!,1
Arabella Julies gave excellent service,5
"A client of Dotsure drove into my vehicle last week Thursday,  I have now made several phone calls to Dotsure to lodge a 3rd party claim, ive been speaking to different people each time i call,  lots of promises made to me about someone calling me back ""today still"", lots of promises that ""someone will be in touch"", then pushed to different persons in different departments each time I CALL BACK when i dont hear from anyone, and 5 days later still no assistance. 
You guys should really stop bragging about your service on TV and actually start servicing. I am so grateful that I am not your customer and purely doing a 3rd party claim (with no joy). I wont sign up with DotSure anytime soon....

Persons names I do have that have messed me around to date: Mayveline Du Preez (person supposedly handling the claim from Legal, Bridget Mkhabena (makes promises she cant keep) and the worst of the lot is Athenkosi Fuzani who is the person I was told to speak to from day 1 regarding the claim who never remembers  who I am and just puts me through to other departments with no explanation.

Claim number DOTA**********-00002",1
"Buks Nel - Interviewed me for the claim I lodged with Dotsure, he handled our matter very professionally. He has been giving us updates on the progress, treated us with respect. Awesome client experience, keep up the excellent work.",5

She was very professional and very helpful and friendly,5
Jeanr√© was very friendly and helpful. She made the process easy with very good service.,5
"Was too good to be true it seems. I have had great previous experiences with dotsure in the past but it seems it was just a matter of time before you showed me that you can also just be like any other insurance company out there. Bad service and poor communication with no care of how you affect your clients. I submitted a very valid claim for an emergency procedure after our dog was bitten by another dog. This is exactly the reason why people have pet insurance! For cases like this. But you decided to only pay out less than half of the claim and reject the rest. No reason given, no phone call or email or SMS. No communication of any form! I must just somehow accept that you are not fulfilling the main reason that I pay dotsure for every month. I phoned your call centre yesterday to try and figure out what was going on and after countless different options, finally got to speak to the right person who turned out to be the wrong person. I was promised feedback yesterday but I was ignored again it seems. No feedback and still don't know why you would reject a claim like that. You are pulling the same sh*t that all the other companies do to their clients. Strongly considering deleting all the previous positive reviews I did for dostusre and also looking elsewhere for pet insurance. I want to know that my dogs are actually covered in cases of emergencies. But let's see if you actually deal with this the right way first",2
Gabriella Julie's helped me. She was really friendly and explained everything to me,5
Bernadine was fantastic,5

"Dear Justin Jafta

Thank you for your excellent service.

 Thank you for caring for my Bella puppy.",5
"Michaela Cronje handled my claim for my dog. She emailed me correspondence and was in contact with me during the process via mail and phone. On the day of the ""approval"" where I got a laughable R400 approved of my multi thousand rand op to my dog (I signed up to Dotsure 6 months ago and signed up for the most premium plan, paying for the year ahead)

Michaela took my call when I wanted to request explanation for the non approval of the total amount. She started laughing and in a mocking voice said there is nothing they can do and hung up. I have had a lot of people who don't care about their professionalism over the years, but this person's attitude in a business capacity was shocking. She does not belong near a customer, and definitely not near an institution like Dotsure. I asked if I may speak to her manager, she said yes, and then stuttered and laughed and said no i must call customer care general line. The fact that she hung up is a showcase of pathetic service. This should be on their ads on TV. Because this is how customers are dealt with.",1
Good service,5

I received a call from one of their Agent after numerous missed calls, He wanted to inform me that they have taken over from Hollard insurance and assured me that my cover is not affected and should I wish to get a copy of my contract they‚Äôll email it to me. Excellent Communication skills to the gentlemen whom I received the call from.",5
"Sonja Pangel ‚Äì It wouldn‚Äôt be right not to commend you on the Excellent Customer Service that you have provided to me. Everything that you explained to me was crystal clear,  the way you explain and make your clients understand what is needed to be understood is just perfect.

Thank you dotsure.co.za, for ensuring that I have peace of mind - always!
With appreciation - Susa",5
"I love Dotsure. I have had to claim twice for my dogs vet bills, and both times I have been paid out quickly. This last time Chante Du Plooy was my claim handler, and she kept me up to date with the process from claim submission through to payout. Well done Chante, was a pleasure dealing with you.

She was spot on! Friendly, professional, and efficient are adjectives that do not begin to describe Chante. Instead of the 2-3 working days turnaround time for payout, I received it the next day (which happen to be a Saturday). Dotsure Pet Insurance is highly recommended! Thank you, Chante! Thank you Dotsure!",5
Best service from Jeanr√®. Very helpful.,5

I would just like to say that Jean Boshoff was an amazing consultant and helped me through the process of get my pets insured speadily and with such a great attitude. NExt time you call for pet insurance ask for Jean Boshoff by name he is a great consultant,5
"Wow. I can not tell you what it is like to have such kindness be shown by a corporate company. I very sadly lost one of my babies a week ago due to kidney failure. I have been dreading submitting the claim and stopping his premium as that would make it 'real real' you know. I submitted the claim and have only been met with kindness, understanding, and compassion. 

I felt so rude on the phone as I was trying so desperately not to burst into tears so I was hardly responding and Caitlyn Kelton was so sweet to me. 

What really brought me to tears was receiving your 'Sorry for your loss email'. The fact that you feed a hungry baby for a month at the AACL in Lexi's honour has touched us more than you will ever know.

Some people can't have human babies so your furbabies really are your babies. Thank you for understanding that my Lex was and always will be more than a 'pet'. He was my baby.

"Consultant Ashley Taljaard was very friendly, professional and explained the options clearly. Was a pleasure dealing with her.",5
"Specifically for Pet insurance:
Make sure you read all t&c. Max cover of (amount) does not mean you are covered by that amount. Each line item has its own limit, and far underways the actual cost in your time of need. (Payout less than 10% of full bill, around 50% of max cover.) I've The payout for my emergency is less than what I've paid in 9 months.

What I experienced during pet emergency:
-left message to get called, instead get a sms with name and number (and when calling, no one worked there with that name)
-person I spoke to refused to help me cause it was in my mother's name. Even when I told her my mother is here, and can put her in speaker, she said ""we can't help, read your policy""
-after speaking to my mother for her ID, the lady kept in telling us to read our policy, and did not want to help us understand what cost/cover would be like.

Note: the above is what I experienced while dealing with needing to make a call that will cost a large sum of money, or put my dog down.

I've had way better experience with car insurance, where the caller understands you are going through something and actually wants to help you.

I would not say they wronged me, or went against the policy, but be warned:
-the policy is deceiving, if you can just afford standard cover, rather save the money in a bank.
-difficult to get on the phone in your time of need
-unhelpful, borderline rude when you need assistance.",1

"Thank you Jade Mooi-Bradshaw for your excellent service, you are a gem!!!!",5
"Dotsure refuses,yes again, to cancel additional excesses on a claim even when it is impossible to produce certain documents due to the current pandemic. Horrible service,it's like not having insurance at all. I cannot pay around 25k excess even though I was rear ended. Appalled really.",1
"Just want to say thank you to Monique Viljoen for her excellent service, a true gem to Dotsure, thank you for your friendly service, you are the best.",5
"I had the most amazing young lady by the name of Amber Bird contact me, she was incredibly patient with me even though I took ages to sign up my babies.

I was helped by Ms Nicky. I received the most amazing service ever. She is the absolute best. She explained the cover to me in such detail. I was surprised by the excellent cover dotsure offered me as well as the amazing service I received from nicky,5
"On the 28th of October, Dotsure sent me an email informing me that there would be an increase in my premium. I did not wish to pay said increase so decided cancel my  insurance scheme instead.   After forwarding my email stating I wished to Cancel my policy I was given a four day run around stating I was only able to cancel the policy via phone call and not in writing. This posed a problem as I am a Ships captain and was out in the middle of the ocean.    I provided The insurance company with a means of contacting me only to be informed that phoning abroad was not permitted and that an exception would be made to allow me to terminate the policy.  Once agreeing to my request, the consultant decided to try retain my business by offering me a lower package at a reduced rate.   Ruth Duthie was polite, courteous and ultimately successful in her dealings with me and finally managed to get me to stay with Dotsure, albeit it on a reduced package.",3
Bad Bad service especially when assisted by White ladies they just hang up the phone while you are still explaining your frustrations to them I am just P*ssd.and they would just debit without your approval of any of their scheduled policies.,1
"What a terrible experience with Dotsure. Policies added without my consent and after I told representative that I might in future look at more cover. Got two policies cancelled but stil the debit orders went off. Been trying for two days to cancel policy with you, but your cancellation department is either to busy cancelling policies or just dont worry about phoning back. Useless to open a ticket, as it gets closed/resolved in an hour but with no direct contact with me. The representative got my car  reg no wrong, and if you try to add it online, the premium goes up by R129, now this apparently is a sytem error which Dotsure is aware off but doesn't get fixed

I'm still waiting for a call to cancel the policy. Please do so.",1
Incredibly thorough and efficient sign-on and informative sales procedure with D'Angelo Whyte.,5
Hands down the best conversation I have had when it comes to insurance. Jeanre Joubert thank you so much for being so transparent and so 'human' about what it means to take out insurance for your pets. You were an absolute pleasure to talk to and we even had a few laughs about our doggos. Thank you for putting my mind at ease when it comes to the health and safety of our fur babies. Thank you.,5
"I've been using Dotsure since 2017 after my dog passed away. I was always worried about my new pup, especially since she eats things she shouldn't and gets skin rashes. Whenever I went to the vet and claimed back from Dotsure, they paid for almost everything and followed their contractual obligations to the last letter. 

My dog is happy, healthy and doing well, partly in thanks to Dotsure. I've always appreciated their honesty, transparency, integrity and prompt responses. Some of the best customer service I've experienced in years, especially considering most insurance companies just rip you off",5
Thank you to Natassia Fourie. I was assisted with my inquiry within 5 min. Excellent service received,5
Carla Jooste assisted me with all my queries and I am at ease knowing my pup will have great cover. Thanks for the great assistance. Megan,5

A special mention must be made of Erika Richter's efficiency and courtesy in dealing with me telephonically.  Your professionalism is truly appreciated.,5
Kudos and 10/10 to this insurance Co. I transferred all of my family insurance to Dotsure and they have been brilliant. I have have had superior service from every agent I have dealt with. They are really on the ball and make clients feel valued. I have recommended them to many.  Shout out to Portia who handled our car hire reservations through Hertz. Dotsure are a first class team and I feel secure in their care. Really excellent value for money too. I highly recommend them to you!,5
Jackie was amazing and efficient!,5
"my car had electronic failure of boot remotes and electronic windows they refuse to pay claim even today ,I took the matter to Ombuds who are dealing with it

2.had a claim for second car under mechanical breakdown cover 
iam covered for short shafts, cv joints, bearings etc. etc. for suspension parts claim was referred to their assessor who did assessment and send damage report instead they choose to pay only 1 item which is 1 shaft the other parts not paid 

3.Their compliance   department has rotten individuals the likes McNeil and his team they not competent as they judge based on hearsay no investigation they do  they always stick on 1 thing wear and tear which they cant even explain why they came to that decision is so frustrating 

people I will not encourage anyone to use this insurance is useless majority of the staff are incompetent ,when your claim is approved they pay 3 times less than what their registered repairer quote ,they never paid full amount 
I will be switching to reliable insurer soon waiting for outcome from Ombud this insurance is rubbish and useless",1

I have not claimed yet - hence the 4 stars..  :)Thank you so much !!!!",4

I'd give her and dotsure 10 stars if I could!,5

My father recently passed away and I wanted to claim the funeral cover that was part of my life cover. I submitted a contact form online. Was contacted by Alma within two hours who was sympathetic and patient in explaining the documentation I needed. She sent me an email following our conversation again listing the required documentation. Once submitted it was Alma who then contacted me again saying my claim was approved and the money was paid in less than an hour. Brilliant service in what is the most difficult period of my life. Alma was kind and attentive. I loved the fact that she followed up on every step so I only had one person to talk to and no need to repeat the story to multiple people. Dotsure you have a gem as an employee,5

"dotsure took over a policy from hollard that I had for a car that my parents drive.  the transition went very smooth and I kept all my benefits as it was, although the car now are much older than it would have been, had I moved it there now.  I found their service and assistance so good, I also included two of my current vehicles that went out of factory maintenance plans to dotsure.",5
When you have the best it only makes sense to ensure with the best that's why i am at dotsure,5
Not happy.Their service is ok but now they went and upped my monthly premium after they told me they would not because we do not use the car often.In the two years that we had it I dont think we have travelled 5000 km,1
"Great insurance company, i have been with many but none comes close to Dotsure!!!

"I contacted Dotsure last month to change my banking details. The agent advised me that this will be implemented however on the 30th, a debit order from my old account was done. I had to pay for this debit order and thus also caused me financial inconvenience. I called thrice today, today; the first time agents were unavailable as they were busy on calls. The other two times I was directed to the incorrect department where nobody could assist me. 
I asked to speak to a manager however I was advised that this could not be done!",1
I will like to rate Marizel Bernardo at dotsure  service a 5 star . She is super nice and friendly .,5
"I had a mechanical breakdown on Friday between next to Queenstown traveling to East London rushing for a 13:40 flight,  I received a most disgusting treatment & unprofessionalism from Dotsure. They towed my car to VW Queenstown,  I needed a  courtesy car that I'm paying for every month, they told me that I will get it after 48 hours.  I was left stranded with a toddler, with so much luggage. The staff members were so rude they kept on dropping phones and giving me different information. I missed two flights and had to travel on the following day. I spent R6100 more because I had to book another flight & I couldn't make it even to the second flight.  I've just spoken to their consultant now he told me that they will approve courtesy car after receiving some documents, something that they didn't mention when they were introducing their company to me because my mechanical plan was with Hollard and Dotsure took over from them. What they are continuing to do to me ,I don't wish it even on my worst enemy,rude unprofessional, unreliable company.",1
Professions. Fast.,5
"Charlize Minnaar  I had such an amazing experience with Charlize. She gave me information that was beneficial and useful to me.

"Pierce Kapp was amazing during consultation, highly recommend dotsure",5
"Dotsure is a company that is very near and dear to my heart. This company has not until now let me down. Always friendliness, efficiency, and faster than ""Fast & Furious"" with payouts of claims. They keep you up to date what is happening with your claim by sms, email and a call when claim is finish. Our little pug is diagnosed with Dermatitis Acopy and we and the vet were very discourage. Then a new injection was found and Dotsure didn't hesitate to pay.
Micheala Conje the agent that helped me a few times is brilliant. She is very friendly and very helpful. She notify me with a phone call and assure me that my funds will be in my account within 2-3 working days but it was so far always sooner, 
Thanks to the other agents as well. You all are stars in our furry child's life

Thank you for your excellent service!! It is much appreciated.",5
"I took out pet insurance for my 2 dogs, cancelled it the NEXT day because of financial issues that was not for seen. They insisted to phone me to cancel, I phoned 2x and could not speak to the person, left messages for her, she never came back and Dot Sure deducted the premium. What can I do???",1
"Gershwin Lewis was very professional and helpful, I signed up in just a few minutes. He was thorough and explained the policy options available.",5
"Please be careful of Dotsure Insurance, they call you for a better insurance quote and tell you you it is a no obligation quote. The trick is, they want your banking details upfront before they even give you a quote. Be very careful I fell for their scam and now only have one hope, the ombuds for short term insurance. They send me their quote and contract and upon reviewing their contract I realised that there many clauses (T&Cs) which did not resonate with me and I wrote back to them to advise that I was not taking their insurance and the rest is history. They harrassed me until I decided not to take their call. They kept on sending me a welcome email and I responded more than 3 times to their email to say I am not taking their insurance. Guess what they went ahead and debit my account. This is a complete abuse. That is not all, they then gave my details to one of their partners Oarkhurst Insurance including my banking details to debit me something I don't know. This is an instance of POPIA breach and violation of my right to privacy. I am going to report them to both the regulator for POPIA violation and to the Ombuds for abusing their licence.",1
Jeandre was professional and very helpful. Appreciated,5
"Really fast service, a billing error happened and I call immediately the next day, Jo-Ann Louw helped me within five minutes. Very friendly and supportive.",5

"I have pet medical aid with Dotsure and can highly recommend them. They are so friendly and efficient it makes claiming a breeze!  It‚Äôs wonderful to receive such wonderful service, something I do not take for granted.",5
"PLEASE make sure everyone reads the small print. My fur babies have been on Dotsure for over 5 years on the 2nd highest plan. When Freddy was diagnosed with lymphoma cancer in Sept 2021, our wonderful vet recommended chemo. Naturally this plan did not cover a lot of the costs, but when we rolled over into our new year's policy benefits, I am not allowed to use these for his chemo as he had a pre-existing condition, notwithstanding that he had been on Dotsure for over 4 years. This is absolutely unacceptable, uncaring and unfortunately is evidence of Dotsure growing so quickly that the family feeling that was so evident in the beginning has now disappeared into their new corporate approach. Shame on you Dotsure...for a poor beagle who will make it but I am questioning my commitment to a company that has become money and not animal-focused. I am looking at other service providers. Sadly as soon as you miss one of their mails or calls, the ticket is then closed. Paying nearly R500 a month for such appalling and unfeeling treatment is all too evident of the approach of most SA companies",1
Marizel Bernardo was amazing in every sense. A real asset to Dotsure.,5

"Good day

I am really not happy with how everything happened yesterday which made me wonder if m I really in good hands...I downloaded the AA app which I felt was not helpful, then at 19.30 I finally was able to communicate with someone at 19.40 I sent my location during that time I was telling the lady I was in a call with that I don't feel as though it is the same location as my home but m not use to being that side I only pass by and now there were guys that were going up and down looking at the car one even knocked at my window and said hi at that point I realised that if loadshedding finds me here these guys are going to come back for me coz m alone with the kids. I had to call my father to try and find one of his friends to come pull me coz m not sure how long will I wait until I get help, my father came with his friends and helped me at 8.00 I called to cancel the request coz I was already home safe I left a voicemail since no consultant able answer my calls. Only at 21.58pm I received a message that someone was dispatched to assist me after 2 hours yet I did say that I was feeling unsafe.

There was no way I was going to wait in an unsafe place with guys busy knocking on my window at night in the dark for 2 hours there was absolutely no way. And I am really disappointed. We live in a country where it takes less than 10min for some to be killed I couldn't wait that long.

Please better your services.

Regards
Mercy",1

"In October 2021 my policy was moved from Hollard (PAWS24) to Dotsure with less benefits, but at least the commitment that the premium will remain the same.  Low and behold, in my very first month as a Dotsure customer on this policy I get a notification that my premium will be increased from December 2021.   The Dotsure response is ""Sorry for the inconvenience, but we are aligning premiums with Dotsure assessed risk profiles""!  I've been a Customer for one month, and already treated like the Customer does not matter at all, and commitments made are irrelevant.  Not sure I will remain at Dotsure!",1
Amazing and professional service from Jaen Boshoff. An absolute pleasure.,5

Trying to understand why would u increase a member premium 2 months after u adjust it with a review?!? ... Attention ro Client service. Must say.. I Miss Oackhurst.  VERY DISSAPOINTING...,2
I have a comprehensive policy with dotsure.co.za since last year.Yesterday 27th of October 2021 a consultant by the name of Zachary Frieselaar called me and he pretended he wanted to update my existing policy.I had a shock of life this morning when I saw an email from him he made me join a GENERAL EXPENSES COVER without my knowledge and this cover will deduct R104 monthly from my account. This unacceptable and I want to cancel the even the EXISTING COMPREHENSIVE POLICY. How can you scam your own customers.,1

"1 star is alittle to high, it's all smiles when they sell you a policy.when you need to claim it's every excuse not to help or make it difficult. When you call a very unsure person helps you, then the claims consultant provides you with no information. The go to line we will send you a SMS and follow the steps. It's pointless to have insurance with dotsure.co.za, if I wanted to run around to get my own plumber and pay up front and then wait to find out they Do not cover the claim I would of saved the premiums and used it when I needed it. It's a maintenance issue that's what's said to you. The plumber said they had 6 claims of the same issue around my area how does that work. I waited 12 minutes for help and had to call 4 different times. i can't say how disappointed I am with dotsure.co.za the friendly greetings and smiles are just a front. I will be moving all my insurance away for sure, two years of premiums wasted.",1

Amazing service and claim process from Carlin Williams. Thank you to the Dotsure team for their amazing work.,5
"Pet Insurance. They are very quick to phone and respond with premium increases, but with claims.....

1st Claim: Our dog, bit my son, had to get stitches, paid the bills, etc. I submitted a claim, just to find out the fine print does not cover when your dog bites a direct family member......... Claim rejected......

2nd Claim: Our dog bites my friend's little girl, we took her to the doctor for vaccination and to clean it and WE paid the bill. I submitted the claim on 3 October 2021, send 4 follow-up emails, and this morning when I send another email, after throwing my toys, I received a call from Brendan, a manager or something, and nicely apologized for ""No services"". Right after that, someone else phones me, and immediately wanted to help, by saying they will send me more forms and then he asked if we paid already for the 3rd party claim??? Of course we did, it is my friend's child and we are responsible and should we have just left the girl without taking her to the doctor????? Then he informed me, the ""fine print"" on the policy reads that we are not supposed to pay for it.... we should submit the claim for payment to them??????? After 3 weeks with no feedback or service, the poor girl would have lost her had.

Go and read the fine print - they are just stealing money.

WORST PET INSURANCE - CANCELLED MY POLICY IMMEDIATELY",1

"It's funny how you can pay your clients clam but they cannot delay the third party claim,  the inconvenience of having to call and email for feedback only to get 'refered to management' meanwhile my safety hangs in the balance.",1
What a pathetic excuse of a insurance. There is no service what so ever. I called yesterday to speak to Jaco G about my vehicle that is still not ready and left a message for him to call me back still no luck. So j tried go day again and Jaco G still as not returned my call. Then you call again after 5 and then there is a answering machine that says business hours are from 08.00 to 18.00 hrs and no body answer the phone they have all gone home I will never recommend dotsur. To anyone this is a Pathetic Excuse of a insurance company,1
I have received truly exceptional service from Jaen Boshoff at Dotsure. We recently adopted a boxer puppy and decided to look at the various pet medical insurance options out there. I obviously did my research before reaching out to Dotsure and I have not been disappointed so far. Jaen is passionate about dogs and helping people find the best solution for their pet or pets. The policy was explained to me in detail and I was able to make a decision on the spot. It is always a pleasure dealing with people of her calibre.,5

Hi Thea Your service was excellent,5
"I've been with dotsure since April and feel the service is very good.
I submitted my first claim last week Thursday (21st Oct) after my dog ate something which made him sick. On the 26th Oct I got an email saying they cover everything and will pay the bill in full, as well as a cute  ""Get Well Soon"" card.

The only slight  downside is the time it takes to get reimbursed, I'm my case over a week as the money may only reflect on the 29th. But they did send as sms saying that they received more claims that usual , so it might not always take as long. 

So if you can afford to pay the vet bill and survive till the reimbur*****t I highly recommend them.",4

"I have to give a huge compliment to Dotsure as well as Natani Taljaard. 

I have been with Dotsure over a year now. But because of financial restrains I had to cancel. Now coming from a call center background myself I was ready for push back and someone on the other line making it almost impossible to cancel and then leaving a fowl taste in your mouth.

Natani Taljaard tried to work out another quote that is a little better due to my affordablity but I unfortunately have no wiggle room in my budget. She was extremely understanding and friendly she did her work perfectly. She really insured that even with canceling I would recommend Dotsure and sing their praises.",5

"I am so disappointing in the service received from Dotsure this time around.  I submitted a claim on the 12th of October 2021 and it is still not settled. I think Lee-Ann Heideman dealing with my claim only works on a Friday as she called me on Friday the 15th of October 2021 to advise me that the invoice is outstanding. I submitted the invoice again on the 15th immediately after she called me and today only I receive a sms to say that the invoice is received.  This is such a small amount that I am claiming, Yet is is taking weeks. Normally it takes 2 days for you to pay out claims?  I have not claimed since 2020.  Is Dotsure getting too big that they cannot provide the service anymore??",1

"#FurFamily
Best Pet Insurance available. Never had or have any problems with claims. Extremely helpful and very quick. Personal touch to each email is impeccable.",5
"Taken aback by terrible service. I took out this pet insurance as I was referred to Dotsure by friends. I submitted a claim iro my dog, duly completing and sending all documentation. The claims administrator asked for additional documents, which I provided. However, after a telephonic conversation with one of the claims administrators to query why I need to provide a medical history for a recue dog, it seemed that the only purpose in asking for the medical history was to repudiate my claim. Regrettably, it also seemed, and one hopes this impression is incorrect, that the consultant tried to elicit an admission from me on the recorded call (which related to medical diagnoses and I was not in a position to make) and which would lead to Dotsure repudiating the claim. I read the policy and could find no basis for Dotsure's possible repudiation, and I have received no response when I asked that they refer me to the relevant clause.

I wrote a complaint detailing the event and mailed in to Dotsure, but received no substantive reply, just the standard autogenerated acknowledgement of receipt they send iro every mail. To my surprise, a few days later I received a further letter, from the same consultant who sent the previous letter, asking for the exact same medical history I had already provided.

I also cannot log in online, as something seems to be wrong with the Dotsure system as well and one does not, despite requesting same to be sent and resent, receive an OTP in order to log in. I initially wanted to add all my pets to this policy, but this has been such an unpleasant experience, on top of trying to help my sick pet, that I doubt I will or that I could recommend Dotsure. To date, no-one from Dotsure has responded to me, but an unexplained amount was deducted from my bank account by Dotsure. I queried this - no response. Anything but hassle-free claims. An investigation of my complaint by Dotsure would be greatly appreciated.

Dotsure is quick and efficient in taking your monthly premium, but then large refunds they drag and don't respond.

Thanx to Sasha-Lee Wilson who has been trying from her side as well to get the claim processed but to no avail. What kind of joke is Dotsure turning out to be?!?

Heaven forbid if you post the generic message as a response to my complaint. I want answers not the below message:
Thank you so much for getting in touch with us and bringing this to our attention. We are so sorry to hear about your experience and apologise for any inconvenience caused. We have referred this to the relevant department and one of our representatives will be in contact with you to investigate this matter further. 

Thanks, dotsure.co.za

"I took out an insurance for our Schnauzer about a year ago, took her for her annual check up a week or so ago and the vet indicated that they need to clean and draw one of her teeth. I paid the vet and I contacted Dotsure to determine if i am entitled to the claim as it was 'unplanned' and our Schnauzer was in pain. Dotsure declined the claim and I was quite surprised it was not covered by the plan. The reason for being surprised and disappointed, I took the senario about teeth as an example when I took the insurance out and the agent stated it will be paid out if such situation come up with our Schnauzer. I will review the renewal very carefully when it comes up for renewal in a month or so.",4

The insurance promised to consider my claim however they did not wanted to pay.  They said the car was not covered during 22h00 and 04h00, and that within the time when accident took place. However on the other side of their schedule we have and aggreed on it state as follows....when a car had accident within the above time, i would be asked to pay an excess amount of 10% of which is R20500. Now that i should do that and them take their part. They refused to pay. Please assist me deal with them so they could pay because the care is also in the banks name.

"#FurFamily

Took out a year upfront, paid for 11 months.. Dotsure 0, Me 1

Declined a claim made 1 day before the effective start date of the policy (based on technicality in fine print on the policy) yet the date I communicated was 30 days before (i.e. the day immediately before the policy start). Went through the complaints process and still no luck (for a R470 claim) Dotsure 1 Me 0 (i couldnt read the fine print).

Website says that neutering is covered. So promptly take my puppy to the hospital, cost almost R2500. Sent claim to Dotsure, refund was only R470 because ""it was elective"" Dotsure 1, Me 0

#FurFamily - Win R1000? - lets see if we can even the score",1

"Our puppy is now a year and 3 months and we have had Dotsure for over a year and a few weeks ago we had to submit our first claim. 1 day my doggo was fine, they next he was limping and wouldnt put any weight on his back foot. We took him to the vet and luckily there didnt seem to be any major issue.  I didnt know what happened. I dont know where it happened (at home somewhere). All I knew is that my doggo wasnt doing ok. The claim process was so easy. Hop on to the website, scan in your claim form and invoice from the Vet and attach. I must say I was a little nervous going through the process as I was sure they werent going to pay the claim. I didnt know how he had hurt himself. Received an sms after submitting the claim to give me my claim number and the personal handling the claim and that they would be in contact with regards to the claim. And just a few hours later they called to follow up. We where heading into the long weekend and was sure they would only get to it the following week but again much to my surprise they called again either that night or the following night to say they were dealing with the claim. After a few follow up questions they said I would receive feedback as soon as possible. I think it was the Saturday they called to tell me my claim was approved and should receive payment minus the excess within a few days. Which again I did. Even got the best get well card for Reagan. Top notch service is when you say you will do something and then actually doing it. So happy keep it up.",5
it is a perfect policy's,5
"We are with Dotsure now for a year, and we made our first claim last month, after 30min of submitting our claim I received a call saying that they received our claim and it has been approved and payment will be made in 2 to 4 workings days.  That evening we received our payment.  

 They really care about their fur clients and even ""emailed"" Freya sending her warm wishes for her recovery. I Will recommend them to anyone that needs pet insurance   #bestpetinsurance #happyclient",5

"#FurFamily
On the 7th June this year I lost my husband of 39 years and exactly 2 months later his beloved Africanis dog had to be rushed to the hospital for a suspected tear or blockage in her gut. I actually thought I was going to lose her as well. The good news was she pulled through and the fantastic news was I made use of my first ever claim with Dotsure and it was absolutely first class! The consultant was so helpful, paperwork was done quickly and in the blink of an eye I was paid out for my claim!
ANYONE who is mulling over which insurance to use for their pets, take it from me Dotsure is outstanding.  Thank you for the follow up 'get well' message you sent me and little Curby Dotsure, it was so appreciated.",5

"Hey guys and gals. If i were to win one of these R1000 prizes, rest assured it will be donated to the Alberton SPCA. Now, onto DOTSURE. We recently got our little pup Enzo (Staffie), and from our previous experience with medical bills, we decided we were going to put our little guy on a medical aid scheme. Alot of shopping around and looking at options and eventually got hold of Dotsure. They came back to me with options based on our chat. My wife and I discussed it and decided that we will go with Dotsure. Best decision we made for our little guy. Only 5 months into the policy and our little guy decided it would be fun to chew up branches and whatever else he could find. He developed bad running tummy and this freaked us out badly. We rushed him to his doc and got him sorted. Sent through the claim form with invoice, and no questions asked, my claim was paid out in 2 day...... 2 days guys, what insurance does that. I will NEVER change from Dotsure as they truly are a market leader. Thank you everyone at DOtsure for making this process simple and quite frankly a pleasure to deal with. Our little guy is running around again and more than happy with life.",5

"DOTSURE TOOK OVER THE PET POLICIES OF PETSURE/HOLLARD.

IN A LETTER DATED 21 APRIL 2021 FROM HOLLARD THERE LOYAL CLIENTS WERE ASSURED THAT THERE WOULD BE NO CHANGES TO BENEFITS OR PREMIUM.

THE PREMIUM HAS REMAINED THE SAME, BUT THE BENEFITS HAVE MOST DEFINITELY CHANGED AND SUB LIMITS INCLUDED WHICH WERE NOT THERE BEFORE.

THE CALL CENTRE AGENT DOMINIQUE TOLD ME THAT THEY HAD TO CHANGE THE POLICY TYPE TO FIT INTO THE PREMIUM THEY COULD CHARGE. I WAS ON THE ""PRIME"" POLICY........ MOST EXPENSIVE AND BEST BENEFITS WITH PETSURE........ NOW I'M ON ""STANDARD"" WITH DOTSURE.

READ THE POLICY SCHEDULE FELLOW POLICY HOLDERS.

I HAVE BEEN A LOYAL AND FAITHFUL CUSTOMER OF PETSURE FOR 13 YEARS.

"Morning. I have sumthing heavy on my heart. I am insured with my car at dotsure. I bought my polo vivo last year November brand new. Never had its 1st service. 3weeks back, sum1 drove in front of me, my car badly damage. Notified dotsure, they did all needed to b done, called me back, assessor wrote my car off. Settlement was R256 800.00.Dotsure sent me an email, stating, they will only settle R148 000,i must settle the rest. So why do I pay for insurance, but the day u need to claim, they have all excuses in the world not to help. Pls people, before u think of joining dotsure, think twice. Make sure u r covered completely. Now, I can't buy another car, due to I must settle R106 000 out of my pocket, which I dnt have, so, put 2 and 2 together, and never join dotsure. First time ever this is happening to me.",1
"Hello
I'm disappointed with dotsure 
In March 2021 I was involved in an accident with a drunk driver whom has confirmed to be at fault. Hollard was my car insurance company at that point but dotsure took over before my case was resolved. Hollard charged me an extreme access amount of R4000 to repair my car with the intention of recovering the money from the drunk driver but nothing was done.
This access I acquired from a loan I took as I need a car urgently. Hollard gave me the run around under the pretense of trying to recover my access.
Then all of a sudden dotsure took over the Hollard car insurance and they took are giving me the run around by telling me the drunk driver is unemployed which by the way I brought it to dotsure attention that the drunk driver actually has his own company and is doing well compared to my circumstances. Dotsure refused to press legal charges to this person and continuously changes people in the company to deal with my case.
At one point they didn't even has the drunk drivers identity number or phone number I had to give it.
7 months and nothing has been done yet I'm paying for a loan when it was not my fault and the drunk driver confessed to the police on the scene he was drunk and a breathalyzer test was done the guy was arrested.
And the guy also confessed to Hollard and dotsure he was at fault.
This is totally unfair as not all of us are rich some of us are struggling and people like this come and add more stress on our lives and we don't have finances to pay and the companies we trust betray us too.",1
I had a great experience the service Amber gave was excellent and im very happy with my product.,5
Great and friendly service received from Jeanre. Affordable pet insurance cover adjusted to your needs.,5
"Their customer service is great. I have no complaints regarding that. I just thought to inform other dog lovers that you have to have the funds in your account for any vet treatment with dotsure and dotsure reimburses you. I feel the reason for taking out insurance for my dogs is so that I don't have to euthanize them due to me not being able to pay R18000 for a surgery they require.

I almost euthanized my dog as dotsure doesn't pay the vets upfront. The company I will be switching to pays the money upfront so that you can pay the vet in order to save your fur baby.",3
"I've never experienced such good customer service from Dotsure than today. Nkosinathi Mngadi, this gentleman was just all that today. He kept me calm over the phone, he was very helpful and understood what I was looking for and how Dotsure can assist. It's important to have people like this gentleman that understands the product or service the company is offering in order to be able to assist in the best way possible. Thank you Dotsure, thank you Mr Nkosinathi Mngadi.",5

"Good day 
My name is Sebastian Parasaraman and i am Insured with Dotsure, and I'm having such terrible service from their claims department ,
i had an incident in July 2021 and till now my car is still damaged. I had to always call in to check up on my claim, and have been advised by the Claims handler such incorrect information and lied to on so many calls   on a so call reordered line , and even his manager is not looking into it .
i have contacted their Complaints department , and even sent an email asking for assistance and till now , no reply or even a phone call , 
Due to the incorrect information given to me from the Claims handler on numerous calls  , i now paid a Panel beater a deposit  based on what the claims handler advised to me , due to all the damages not being covered as per  Dotsures Assessor, and  now i am out of pocket , as they are refusing to Honor what was advised to me on numerous occasions by the claims handler ,  by settling me directly to have the car repaired  .
This  has now lead to  me even contacting an laying a complaint with the Short Term Insurance  Ombudsman, and nobody from Dotsure has  even bothered to sort this out or look into it or honor what their claims handler has advised to me , or even call me to resolve this matter",1
"I have been a Dotsure customer since 2018. I added a cat to my family (and my insurance) in 2020 and was met by a few challenges such as being doubly charged and waiting very long to have my claims paid out. However, my latest experience with them was really a 5 star experience - I was repaid the expected amount within 4 or 5 days thanks to my consultant Michaela. They even covered the surcharge price I had to pay because the injury fell on a weekend. I'm very grateful.

The only suggestion I'd have to improve their service would be if they sent us those orange bandanas they've gifted their other customers so we can show them off at our all vet visits.",5

She is knowledgeable and gave me the best advice for me at that time, she went above and beyond the call of duty and answered my every concern, fear and question, she even advised me in nutrition my Jasper who is a rescue and I am a first time pet parent. Kate is truly an animal liver that is clear as daylight and she even asked for pictures of Jasper. Her services provided was amazing, I am so impressed with dotsure, unfortunately not long after I took out cover my jasper had a bad head injury and I have just submitted the claims and got paid out in just a few days, no questions asked, no excuses and the thing that touched me the most, dotsure sent Jasper a get well soon card which was just too precious for words.

"This is for Dotsure's car insurance. 
In August this year (2021) I was on holiday with my three kids. Only a mother and her 3 kids. We just spent our last night in a great tented camp in the Magaliesberg, between Brits and Hartbee****rt. While packing everything back in the car, one of the girls accidentally left the car keys in the boot and closed it. 
We tried to open the seats from the inside, but missed how to go about. The very friendly and helpful hosts tried to help me however they could, but we still didn't manage to get the boot open, So the only alternative was to call a locksmith. Also, not carrying my policy documents with me, I didn't even think about first calling my car insurance. So we just called around and found the first available (it was a Sunday) and quickest one (we still had to drive a 6 hour drive home). After they helped us, which took maybe half an hour? they handed me a bill of R2800! Yes.. R2800. The guy said, it's no problem, I can just send the bill to my car insurance and they will pay it back. What a relief! 
Nope. So, when I got back at work, 2 days later, I sent Dotsure the bill (that we have already paid of course) and asked for a refund. It was not to be a relief at all. They say I had to call them first and they would send me a locksmith... Sorry, I didn't check my policy document before I tried to get home.
Then I complained and tried to take it further, but every time I was just told that a consultant would come back to me. I asked a few times, but no consultant came back to me still! They're just brushing me off and hope that I would now keep quiet. I was trying to ask them, if they had found the locksmith, and it would have worked out cheaper, couldn't they then just paid back the cheaper amount instead of just shrugging their shoulders at me?!
VERY DISAPPOINTED",1
Very friendly and proper service and information. Can tell he knows what he is talking about and snot just reading a script.,5

"What a wonderful experience. This didn't feel like I was taking up pet insurance more like a friend giving me information on something I'm interested in. No forcing me to get started immediately, and allowed me to process the information she gave me and said she will call be back when I'm ready, that I just need to pop her an email. She listening to what I need and advised me accordingly, no upselling, or attempting to convince me that a higher cover would be more beneficial, she merely advice me that should I wish to up or down scale that I am more than welcome to do so. I love that this didn't feel like I'm another number and a sale to be made. Looking forward to many years of happy cover for my baby. Thank you Fefe!",5

Make sure you never insure with dotsure car insurance you regret when you have a accident they make you run around for qoutes but and the end they dont use none of the quotes you submit then they tell you who can repair the car at they qoute amount that is 50% less then the quotes you have submitted from they own service providers that is on they panel then there a handling fee is for your account but none this is mentioned in the contract worst sevice you must call every day  to follow up on you claim to help then do they work they need to be reported to the competition commission about this they agree with to and say the claim is finalized then the next day the reverse the claim with no consult you must phone to fine out,1

"I'm so disappointed with your service towards me and I wouldn't recommend your company to anyone because of poor service you rendered to me I made a claim in July 2021 then you said I must take my car to Durban South Panel Beater for the repairs and I did so. Since then I haven't got my car back if I enquire about it they always tells me they are waiting for the parts. I bought the car because I wanted things to be easier for me like going to work and transporting my kids to school of which is impossible now. It's been 2 months paying the insurance and the car which is not at me and I'm also paying for transportation fee for me and my kids too, which is now very costly for me and this thing puts me in an extremely tight position financially . I need my car back. This thing makes me reconsider of changing to another insurance company üò†üò†üò†",1

"I am really not happy with this company. They are not accommodating to their customers at all with regards to payment.  I asked them so nicely that they take the money of on the 25th as by the 1st there will not be any funds available.

They managed to get the R50 starting fee, but the monthly fee didn't go through.  Then without even contacting me, they debit my account again 15/09/2021 with both amounts.  This cost me a total of R345.00 in bank charges.  Who is going to pay this?

I want this sorted out and in the meantime my pets are not insured, thank you to a team who do not know how to look after their new customers.

Very unhappy.  I want the R345.00 in bank charges or they can use it for my account to be insured.

Thank you

"I have been a Dotsure client since August 2016. I have five dogs covered with Dotsure. Three boxers and 2 great danes.

I have upgraded my four younger dogs to the Ultimate Plan in 2021, having claim limits of R35,000 and overall R100,000. I have taken out the waiver of the sub limits. 

On 12 June, my 4 month old great dane had an allergic reaction, which we suspect was an insect bite. Of the total claim of just under R2,000, only R1,280 was paid. I asked for an explanation of what was not covered on 14 June 2021. I followed up on 3 August 2021. To date, no response. This is really a first for me as I have been use to exceptional service from Dotsure, but not the case this time.

I am questioning whether I am actually just wasting my money on the the Ultimate Plan, and whether this plan will actually step up when I have a major crisis, or will it only pay 65% of the claim?

I love my four legged children and want only the best for them. Not really sure that this is the best to be honest.",2
My dog had recently been diagnosed with addison's disease and I've had to submit many claims over the past few weeks. I would like to thank Dotsure and Tiola Smit for their amazing service! They always provide quick feedback and friendly service,5

A lady by namenof Bridget explained they are not allowed to transfer to managers but promised a call back. Its been 2 weeks and no call received  as yet. Very bad service to say the least.",3

"Dotsure is the old Oakhurst. They amend your policy without your permission which they use against you not to settle. Very cunning . I had my garage burgled some months ago. My household contents was insured for a sum of R345000. Dotsure sneakily increased this sum to around R365000 few months before the burglary and increased my premium. The premium was reduced back to the original amount after I enquired but the household contents value was not reduced to R345000. I did not asked to be insured for about R365,000. I think the change was sneakily done to include the alarm warranty clause incase of a claim. My claim was repudiated because any value over R350,000 needed a alarm warranty clause. They amended my policy without my permission. Worst company to deal with. Never heard of an insurance company insuring you for more with a lesser premium. Do not insure with Dotsure.",1
I am very happy with  caitlyn Keltons service. She is very humble and she knows her job very well. She came across very well and I appreciate her help very much üôè she is the best,5
"Dotsure is a terible company that does not assist their customers with great service. In an event of a claim they make you to get your own assessor to assess damages etc and you have to pay out your own pocket. They stress you out for documents after they already make a decision on your claim and then you submit everything to them and the reject your claim. I am a tenant in a complex and had 2 events in the last 3 months that has caused damaged to few of my contents and it was caused by heavy rain seeping  in my lounge through the door. I am logged the 1st claim 3 months ago with hollard which was such a breeze they sent their own assesors etc and claim was approved then my policy was transfered to Dotsure and the 2nd claim happened a week ago. I was then told I need to put a structure to prevent water from coming in the home which I had no knowledge that it will actually happen the 2nd time. I am not responsible for the building and the landlord is not in the country to approve a carport for my upstairs apartment on my balcony. I did mention this to dotsure. The dotsure verification lady aloma a rude rude person has told me over the call 3 months period has not been paid n I insisted it was only to have sent her pop which they then acknowledge. She made me so stressed over the call. These past few month I have been terible sick. I had put a wooded structure on my door until I could get the go ahead to fit the carport which all the material has been purchased. I only have 2 kids with no help. I have to do everything on my own. I suffer from bipolar and severe stress and anxiety issues. I am on alot of meds. I can't rush any process to do fittings until I save to pay labor etc to put the carport. My building is not covered by qn insurance company but my contents is covered and damage did happen. Why should the company which is covering my contents reject my claim stating it was lack of due care. How was I suppose to know it was really gona happen while I'm in a process of trying to stop water from entering by putting a carport. I am so sick I have now had to borrow funds as aloma also said while verifying claim that the 1st assessors report is not correct as my sofa is not leather upper ND told the assessor it looks like I covered my sofa at home. Coz its definitely not leather. Then I had to get another assessor from a upholstery company to confirm my sofas was leather. All this from someone that just sits and dictates to people. My take here is if they had a problem with covering me do to water came in the 1st time through the door they should of notified me to do alterations to property to prevent this from happening again or they will not cover my content but they didn't. I just felt the need to do the carport eventually cause it most definitely couldn't be done asap due to lack of funds. They are so rude and don't listen to a customer. I asked for the recordings of everything and they have not sent it to me asyet.
I pleaded to them to reconsider but they refused. I even asked one manager Bernita what should I have done differently being a tenant to avoid this qnd she could not give me an answer. They just brush you off. With no interest of the client. If hollard transfered yourls policy plz bare the above in mind. And note from such good service it gone to the worst service.",1

How many times must I spell my name and address out, how many times must i forward the VIN and description of my current vehicle?

I recommend Dotsure anytime, their fees are not astronomical and you have peace of mind that your animals are taken care of.
Please Thank Bernadine Bence on my behalf, I give her 10 Stars and more.",5
"Still no one is getting back to me so I will write a negative review every week until someone does get back to me.

You have bought over hollards insurance policies.  In the letters leading up to this you told us that the policy would remained unchanged and the premiums would be the same.  This is not the case as you have imposed a per limit claim amount which was not on my previous policy.  In addition you have  imposed exclusions on my policy which were dropped from the previous policy in 2017.  Please fix both of these things.  My cats mean the world to me, and you are taking my peace of mind away from me.",1

I hereby wish to file again a complaint against Dotsure. My vehicle is due for a Service. I spoke to a Consultant named Maureen. She advised I need to pay than claim back from the Ibsurance

I took the Warranty Cover for the mere reason to cover me not to reimburse me. It does not make any logical sense for someone to take out cover and then pay out of their pocket with money they dnt have to claim back from the insurance. Yhe whole transition from Hollard to Dotsure has been one unpleasant experience.",1

"I took out vehicle insurance with Dotsure when I purchased my vehicle.

I was at work and a bit distracted when I took out the policy. I guess I did not thoroughly understand some parts as the agent explained to me. The misunderstanding led to me not being happy with Dotsure as I did not leave sufficient funds in my account for the amount that was supposed to be debited. This caused the debit order to bounce which made me quite irate. 

I started shopping around for other insurers, I had decided on an insurer.
I phoned Dotsure to cancel my policy, that is when I came in contact with Dallin Sondile. He was very professional and understanding of everything, he made me feel valued which was the turning point for me. He made me a counter offer which I accepted. I called the other insurer that I had decided on to cancel my policy which was to commence with them. They gave me another counter offer which I refused, they tried persuading me by saying that Dotsure is still a new insurer and not an established one like them. This did not work. All because of the service that I received from Dallin Sondile. As mentioned previously, he made me feel valued and made me feel that I can trust Dotsure. It has been 2 months and I have no complaints at all.",5
Jaen Boshof friendly and efficient service. Thanks very much,5

"On 21 July I cancelled a policy with effect from 31 August, received no response at all until 23 August by SMS reminding me of a pending deduction 2 days later. I forwarded my cancellation email as a reminder. I received a call the same day explaining that it was too late to stop the transaction from going through, that they will pay back my money in 5 days. They never did. On 3 Sept I sent them my banking details. No response. I want my money back. My cancellation date gave them enough time to organise themselves.",1
"I have been with DotSure for over 2 years and had not claimed as my pet has been healthy. I was planning to cancel my cover, as I felt it was not suiting my needs. Ruth Duthie was very helpful in explaining the changing needs during different phases of life, and she was able to customise my plan to something better suited to our needs. Her friendliness and persistence kept me as a customer. Well done to Dot Sure for offering good telephonic customer assistance.",5

"No one got back to me so I will write a negative review every week until someone does get back to me.

You have bought over hollards insurance policies.  In the letters leading up to this you told us that the policy would remained unchanged and the premiums would be the same.  This is not the case as you have imposed a per limit claim amount which was not on my previous policy.  In addition you have  imposed exclusions on my policy which were dropped from the previous policy in 2017.  Please fix both of these things.  My cats mean the world to me, and you are taking my peace of mind away from me.",1

I did consider other options as this is our fist pet and I had no idea of all the companies out there - but the service from Mazibulo and the company's slogan ""Real purpose. Real difference"" in that for every pet policy bought online they will feed a puppy for a month - was a company I can do business with. A socially responsible company and staff.",5

"I moved my entire portfolio from Miway to Dotsure after getting such wonderful service at quote stage hence I moved. My cover started yesterday but to my dismay I was charged over R800 more than the quoted amount only to find out that there were additional items added that I never agreed to. I had received a call from a Bramley who insisted that he was just calling to ensure that all my details had been covered correctly but I hear this morning that he sold me an Excess cover for my 3 cars as well as cover for damage to Lights, badges and Mirrors which I adamant that I never signed up for and this was snuck in without my consent which is rather disappointing. This has left such a biter taste in my mouth as I am no longer sure if i made the right decision by moving my portfolio over to Dotsure. I had sent an email to Bramley asking him to call me about these additional items and up to now I am still waiting for that call from him... Worst possible start to a new relationship, hope I don't live to regret this move",2

Amazing service Amber Bird,5
I had an insurance with Dotsure.  It started off on my fathers name.  He sadly passed away earlier this year.  I had to change the insurance over to my name.  I thought that went really easy until I've noticed a msg on my dad's phone stating that the tracker is currently a view months in arrears.  I contacted them and they did not put the tracker over to my name.  They took the money each month but did not pay the tracker.  After numerous phone calls I cancelled the insurance.  Then tracker suddenly deducted two months from my bank account.  When I contacted them they stated that I've took out the tracker the previous month that is why they are taking two months and they see that I have cancelled so I will need to pay R1800 cancelation fee.  After I explained my story they took the cancellation without the cancelation fee.  After that dotsure still tried to take a debit order and sending me messages that I have cancelled the debit orders and that I will not be insured if the debit order does not go through.  So the person that was supposed to cancel the insurance did not.  It took two months to sort out.  My experience with them was horrible.  Before I cancelled someone drove into me while standing still.  I have an access buster but wanted to charge me R13 000 access for R6500 damage.  Needless to say my car is still damaged.,1
Thank you for the great service Gabriella Julies! ,5
"We recently added two miniature schnauzers to our family. I contacted Dotsure, and was assisted by Gabriella Julies, who was very friendly and knowledgeable about the different plans. She assisted me in choosing the most suitable plan for our fur babies, Buks and Fafa.

Dotsure is a big FAT JOKE",1

"I submitted the same documents for the 2nd claim, from the same vet as for the 1st claim that was successfully paid out the next day, which I was very happy about. In fact I was bragging about how efficient Dotsure is. I received a request for documents without any explanation as to what is required and I've had to follow up to ensure I understand what is being requested, only to find out that they need the claim form signed and stamped by the vet and need clinical notes and medical history for my puppy. She hurt her ey and has an ulcer in it, the vet applied medication to her eye and gave me eye drops and an eye ointment. All this information can be obtained from the very detailed invoice that I submitted, along with proof of payment. I'm very upset as I'm super busy and now have additional and in my view unnecessary admin. Also, my claims experience has been very different for the 2 claims I've submitted. In your many adverti*****ts on TV you say that the claims process is simple and you pay almost immediately. Well this has certainly not been my experience with the 2nd claim! ",1

Worst service received from dotsure. I submitted my claim from the  warranty  I had at dotsure as my engine had a  faulty part resulting in less performance. For 3 weeks I had to follow-up about the status quo of the claim whilst it was parked in the workshop. After a series of phone calls and emails only today was I told that they do not cover the part. I regard their service as horrible because they could have answered me immediately. Why let me wait for 3 weeks. I canceled immediately,1

Ayana Zulu ,5
"I am really unhappy with dotsure - I had to take my female dog to get spayed due to behavioral issues caused by her not being spayed - the amount for the spay was R3150 - I did not do this for her not to get pregnant I did this so that she will not be aggressive and bite people and or other dogs. 

I was told that that only R475 would be paid of the spay amount.

I really don't understand the reason behind not paying this out in full- I did this out of necessity to avoid a like Third-Party claim which could amount to a hell of a lot more than just R3150. (She already bit a dog twice because of not being spayed and resulted in hospitalization of the dog WHICH I paid for out of my pocket)

So me being proactive and making sure that my pets are healthy and doing things that in the long run would result in fewer claims, I am being penalized for this?

I don't understand the reasoning",1

"My policy was transferred from Hollard to Dotsure in July. I was never contacted telephonically to understand the ramifications of the transfer as still communicated with Hollard on policy issues. I had a mechanical break down on Saturday which Hollard authorized on condition that it would verify the claim as policy showed inactive. On follow up I was told Dotsure was the insurer and they should entertain the claim. Dotsure initially said they did not have my database and as such Hollard should handle it. Eventually, when I insisted on the release of the vehicle so that I could fix it for business purposes, I was told that I used the wrong service provider and should have AA. My concern with this is that I never appointed or authorized the towing but Hollard did and the issue of the service should be handled by the insurers and not the insured. I was also told I need to contact AA to resolve this and I feel it is the duty of the insurer to resolve the issue of towing charges with the service providers and not involve insureds. Costs were incurred for the towing of the vehicle and the insurer covering the event should pay the costs irrespective of who the preferred service provider is and any contractual issues arising from the situation should be resolved by the insurers, I am also deeply concerned by the policy administrators reluctance to provide me with the details of the client service and Claims Manager who have the authority to deal with these issues at policy and principle level as opposed to clerks who dont have the authority to override incorrect decisions by the junior staff. Secondly, my car is accumulating storage fees and I cant release it until this impasse is solved whilst people with authorities are not getting involved to remedy the situation. Its very cool for insurers to debit my account every months but when there is a claim, they drag their feet and do not want to take responsibility. This is poor service and should be condemned.",1
Thank you Waseem for your assistance to get my pets covered. Even trying numerous times to reach me when I was busy. Great service received .,5
"Dotsure handle my claim on my car. They send my car to Ashlee panel shop in Bloemfontein on the 8th July 2021. The accessor access my car from cell phone picture.  He arrange for parts where to buy which went smooth. On the other hand the panelbeater want more money money  when received the parts. When start working on the car he discover, as I told the assessor it will happen, that there are damages underneath the car. He then need more parts and money for labour. Now that the parts are there he want more money to install the parts.  I asked him why he did'nt quate all at the same time and told him to contact the Dotsure assurance.
This guyis playing games with the assurance company by quate piece by piece. At the end it will caused more money as a not nominated panel beater. I had to pay more out of my pocket to get the work start but he delay the process. It is now almost 6 weeks I am waiting for my car. Ashley himself are very rude in his way he talk to me. If he don't like Dotsure customers he must get out of them.
I am very upset with him and his service.",1

Two of my dogs had medical expenses in the past month and dotsure processed both claims very promptly.

They kept me informed of where the claim is in the process and were also kind enough to give me an estimation of cover before I took my one dog in for an operation.

I especially love how detailed their claim cover amount is. It is very clear where your payout is coming from based on your plan and the various limits. 

Make sure you share as much as you possibly can as this really helped the consultants determine what my plan covers based on the cost and the diagnosis.

Will definitely recommend them!",5

"on the 16th of May I had an accident where my car hit a pothole resulting to some damage to the front sensors. On the same day 16th I called the insurance (Dotsure insurance) to have them tow the car to the nearest mercedes dealership (Pietermaritzburg) and so they did, also performing diagnosis and evaluation of the damage.

Mercedes gave me quotation of the damage for me to give to my insurance(dotsure)and so I did. The insurance refused to send their assessor to the dealership (Mercedes-Benz) and they decided to fetch the car from the dealership to their preferred panel beaters of which I do not know till this day. The car has stayed with them  for close to 3 months, only for them to decide 3 weeks ago that they will not fix my Car.

I then requested for them to return the car to the dealership where they got it, so the dealership can check if everything is the way it was upon the car being taken, they promised to do so and they didn't.
Then on the 7th of July the tracker company calls to inform of the battery being removed, so I had to call the insurance to ask why was that because they said they will not fix the car, I got no clear answer.they called last week tuesday and claimed the car was sent to the dealership on July 9, which is false.the tracker company on Friday informs me the Car is around Gale Street somewhere around Durban. Till this day the car isn't returned (ND 663636) Charcoal grey GLC 220d 4matic.",1

Thank you Imke for great advise and great service. ,5
"It's my first every Hello Peter complaint and I feel very strongly that others should be warned about Dotsure. They are the worst insurance company I have ever dealt with, they have taken weeks to get back to me despite a number of emails.  Then I'm told that my claim was cancelled due to the fact that they never received a photo of my odometer reading in my car.  I have submitted approximately 20 pictures, only 2 were relevant to my motor car claim.  Then without any notification they decide to cancel the claim.  I have many years experience in business and been  with the same insurance company for 30 years, they unfortunately moved their customer book to Dotsure which has been a total disaster.  I wonder if this is a legit company, I will not leave a stone unturned until my claim has been successfully handled.  This company has no credibility and I  find them completely without integrity, erring on the side of dishonesty.

"I have had my household and allrisk (specified items) covered with Hollard for many years and I must admit that the service I have received when claiming was easy and such a pleasure, especially after I have been in a traumatic situation, unfortunately they have now transferred the existing policies to Dotsure. This is the first time I have had to have the unfortunate incident of claiming through Dotsure. I pay a stipulated premium to cover specified Items(Allrisk) for a specified amount, I have had the unfortunate incident of loosing 2 phones which were insured for a certain amount each, now that I go through the claims process, I am told to get  quote as to what the phones are worth, How ridiculous is that, because I have been paying a premium to cover my phones for a stipulated amount and they want to pay me for what my phone is worth now, how stupid is that!!!. I tell them I have been given a phone by daughter to use and they ask me for an Invoice. I told them I dont need a replacement phone, I want to be paid out, and that was never a problem with Hollard, Basically it seems like Dotsure is just giving me the run around and trying to avoid paying me out the claim.

"Mazibulo Myo was extremely helpful, answered all my questions, and made sure I understood the scope of my policy before getting me registered. ",5

"Hollard sold their car insurance and other parts of the company to dotsure. Dotsure were supposed to take off R165 on the 30th as a pro rata and then from the 10th they were supposed to start taking off R511. This comes to R676. They just took off R1025.54. ????

I have just told my contact my opinion of this in an E mail",4
<div>Chadwick Lewis what a pleasure talking to the man he was helpful and friendly professional and able to help myself and my wife with a policy for our puppydogs who are like our kids.

"Teboho Sengoara very professional and helpfull. 
I will speak to this gentleman the whole day over the phone. 
Thank you sir. ",5
Chad was helpful and amazing! ,5
"I was contacted by Dotsure to review my policy at the end of July 2021. The consultant who called advised that she would like to know if I am happy/satisfied with Dotsure since the take over from Hollard. I asked if the underwriting had changed since I as a consumer was merely palmed over by Hollard, and was told that my policy would remain as is as per the intial insurance contract with Hollard. When we got to reviewing the underwriting straight of the bat there were differences to the policy conditions in relation to what I had with agreed to with Hollard. I immediately requested a copy of the policy wording to review my cover and requested a call back in 72hrs.To date i have not received the policy wording nor have I received received a call back, 10 days later... Clearly Dotsure is inefficient and Hollard just as inefficient and reckless with their clients by merely palming them off to another insurer. Hollard was my preferred choice as insurer, having insurance with them since 2009. Both Hollard and Dotsure have lost my confidence as a consumer and I would strongly advise others not to do business with either based on their extremely poor service standards and ethics. Poor client experience, not how you should welcome a new client Dotsure. ",3
Thank you Jodi Muller for your help to get us started at Dotsure,4
"I want to thank Anastachia Plaatjies for helping me with my accident, she is a angel and really know how to keep you patient after you've been in an accident. I really appreciate all your effort and God will Bless you and also the insurance for all their support. ",5

"Dotsure is treating me like trash, I hut a rabbit and the total cost from their own panelbeater is R32k and now they say they have negotiated with panelbeaters to fix my car for R13k. The car is Golf 7.5 Gti, bumper, lower grille, bumper holder and radiator have to be replaced, how can all that be R13k with all labour and painting that is required? In the entire Eastrand they only have 2 accredited panelbeaters, solely because panelbeaters complain about their treatment on customers when it comes to paying claims, and that they recommend cheap materials on our cars. I have been paying this insurance for 4years under Hollard without any single claim, and this is treatment we get. Hollard has sold us to the crooks.

"<div>My little Jack Russel, Zeus van Zyl had to have an emergency bladder operation where the Vet removed a lot of bladder stones. Operation went well and our little one is getting better by the day. Dotsure was awesome as always and payment was done within 2 days in my bank account. Samantha Armstrong worked with my claims. She was so friendly, considerate and the best ever. She cares for my dogs and is definitely an assett for Dotsure. </div>",5
"They debited 1550 then 199 even though I only had the insurance for 4 days or less if I'm not mistaken, I phoned the company for a refund and they advised that someone was gonna contact me to arrange refund but up until no one has contacted me. I received an email to say the ticket has been closed by the consultant.",1
"I signed up with Dotsure thinking that they are a legitimate company operating on basic insurance principles. Turns out they are nothing more than scammers. Let me give you an example. On Saturday morning 17 July I noticed my dog is keeping her hind foot in the air when walking. I took the dog to the Vet who said it could be inflammation. Vet gave the dog meds and said if the condition does not improve within 10 days that I must come back so a X-Ray can be taken. After 10 days I was back. The X-Rays were taken upon which the Vet established it the dog is suffering from a hereditary condition. I submitted the claim for the X-Ray, only to be told by Dotsure that X-Rays are covered only if the diagnoses done after studying the X-Ray does not result in a hereditary condition being diagnosed. I immediately cancelled my membership because if this is not scamming people then I do not know what is.",1
"Charlize Minnaar is extremely friendly and helpful, she explained everything very well and when I had questions she could answer it.",5

When I was not able to speak he understood and kept communicating with me as to when I was available to speak and that was really incredible.

He is a real example of a peoples person and should be an example to his colleagues. He desires a raise.

"To say that my experience with dotsure has been disappointing is an understatement. I was previously Insured by Hollard and so have migrated to dotsure by default. Three weeks ago I phoned to lodge a claim. Spoke to a very nice lady (I'm not going to mention any names here) who asked for all the details. Called me back to say that I needed to go and get a quote - I asked if I could go to anyone and she said yes. Mistake 1 - once I had submitted a quote with all the other documentation I required, I was told the panel bearers were not on the approved list! There were two pieces of damage to my front bumper, sustained in two separate incidents. What an issue that was. I submitted ONE set of documentation (pictures etc) to cover both incidents (I made this clear in a covering letter) but they were allocated to different people. Seems to me the people at dotsure don't speak to one another because I then got a letter telling me that one of my claims had been cancelled because I had not submitted the documentation requested! I was initially told to submit information to dotsureclaims.co.za but, when that did not get to the right people, I was asked to re - submit to two different e - mail addresses. To add insult to injury, the value of the claim was about R3300 and I was informed my excess was R2500. All that fuss and bother for R800! Why was I not told about the excess from the word go? I have checked through my documentation and was never supplied with a schedule of excess amounts when I was moved to dotsure. This has been my first dealing with dotsure and I think it will be my last. As soon as the repairs have been completed, I will be taking my business elsewhere. I'm very unimpressed. The people you speak to on the phone are very polite but the service is appalling. ",1
Kudos to Nick Mbuzwana for excellent service! He was very patient and clear during our telephonic consultation. Keep up the good work Nick! ,5

"Good morning. I am absolutely disgusted with Dotsure. I have been a long standing client with Regent Insurance, bought out by Hollard and now bought out by Dotsure. Dotsure is a MASSIVE rip off with insurance. I am insured with Dotsure with one car and household cover. I now requested a quote on a second car and I was given a totally ridiculous figure. I request a similar quote from King Price and I am not a client of theirs and they quoted me HALF of Dotsure. Exactly the same cover. How is this possible? Dotsure refuse to budge on a better price, the answer is that is how it is, they are Dotsure now!! It's sickening. Unfortunately my first car insurance quote is higher at King Price than the one I have at Dotsure. So for now I cannot cancel as I am financially constrained. But make no mistake I am taking my business elsewhere as soon as I can just on the principal of the matter. I do not appreciate being ripped off by Dotsure, you should be ashamed of yourselves as a business!",1
Jodi Miller has made signing up for pet insurance an absolute dream. Super friendly and helpful. Excited to work with them ,5
"We have been pleasantly surprised by the level of service we receive from Dotsure. We have both our dogs insured with them and previously had our rabbit insured with them also - which was the initial reason of choosing them, they insure exotic animals. 

We submit our claims and within a day the claim is paid out - no excess, no frills. They interface shows you exactly how much money you have left for specific benefits and they also send it on the claim forms. 

Other insurance companies should really rethink their business strategy and make it as simple and sleek and transparent as Dotsure.

DISCLAIMER: I am not affiliated with Dotsure in any manner - just a really happy client.",5
Excellent service. Couldnt be any happier.,5
"I have car service insurance with the company,  I submitted all the required documents around the second week of June 2021for my reimbur*****t of R1000 , even today I haven't received anything.

My kitties skin all of a sudden went black and her hair started thinning I was dreading the medical bills but was so pleasantly surprised and hugely relieved when Dotsure paid out the full claim within 2 days the money was in my account. My consultant was awesome on the ball! I even got an email to say they hope my kitty feels better soon. Then on top of it I took her back to vet to check bloods because her skin wasn't improving and I had exactly the same experience again! WOW!! Really exceptional service well done Dotsure!",5
"I had a warranty Policy with Dotsure, i had a mechanical breakdown which resulted in my engine ceasing which meant I would need another engine.

"Dotsure car warranty(Gold) is a scam and their service is very poor. My car had a mechanical breakdown as it was overheating and I took it to my nearest BMW dealership to be diagnosed. I was then  provided with a damage report/quotation that highlights all issues on the car . Majority of the components on the damage reports provided by BMW are listed on the parts covered by Dotsure such as cylinder head gasket. Post submitting my claim I received a claim rejection letter via an email saying my claim is rejected as they don‚Äôt cover oil leaks repairs . My car is overheating and this has nothing to do with an Oil leak. They are so quick to sell you their product and assure you that you taking out a great car warranty plan, I would not recommend anyone to use their cover because you can only expect disappointment. I actually urge you to review my claim, send an assessor to BMW to verify what the main issue is as I don‚Äôt believe overheating is due to oil leakage.You can‚Äôt just reject a claim without even verifying information from BMW or sending an assessor. Please have this sorted out immediately.

"I was a policy holder of Hollard, and then they merged with Dotsure, and I automatically became a Dotsure client.  Perhaps they're good if you sign up with them specifically, but this transfer appears to be totally chaotic!  Firstly, they sent me a policy schedule that was full of mistakes (why did they not just copy the existing one?)  Eventually they got the temporary schedule right, and when I confirmed the details, I was issued with an incorrect one (e.g. having 2 geysers instead of 1, and having cover for a boat which I don't even have).  Then two different amounts were deducted from my bank account within one month.  I stipulated the correct details, but they failed to communicate with me.  Eventually I noticed that they had refunded part of the incorrect deductions (without communicating with me about it!) but now, 3¬Ω weeks and at least 6 e-mails from me later, l still have not received the corrected policy schedule.  So, for all intents and purposes, if I happen to have to claim, I may find that I'm not covered by insurance - because the policy I last received, covers me for items I don't possess, but left out an important part of the coverage which I do need, and have paid for ...  ",1
Very professional service. Sales agent  Charlize Minnaar was excellent. ,5
"<div>I am so glad I chose Dotsure, best service hence, best decision I made since 2019 when I insured my car. They are living up to their promises and provide benefits that leaves you stress free. I cannot fault Dotsure services in anyway because the level of your professionalism and urgency to attend to their clients is top tier. A million thanks.</div>",5
"Monique Basson is the BEST! She deserves ALL the Accolades mentioned and more!
We need to clone her and fill the call center with her doubles?
Pitty, being so popular she has become unavailable.
Poor us outsiders are left stuck with individuals that earn a salary! So very sad!",5
"I'm so impressed with Dotsure and the service I received from Megon Andrews. I claimed for the first time today. It took minutes to do online, and within less than 2 hours the claim was approved, and the process closed. During the 2 hours I was updated constantly via mail and sms. That's the way to do things  - I'm absolutely blown away!",5
The best in service that I've ever acquired. I do not regret ever joining dotsure till today..... ,5
I have been with dotsure for 3 years now they have handled my claims excellently and are always helpful and polite when I contact them. ,5

"Having moved not by choice to Dot Sure, they have nothing to show but proven that their customer service is atrocious. I called in for assistance on my account for the first time and received a reference number and promised a callback. To date no callback, I then received emails that my query was resolved and closed.  I emailed them back that this was not the case and still have not heard from them. Bad service and hoping to move to another company as soon as I finalised my new quotes. ",1
"I called Dotsure and D‚ÄôAngelo assisted me with choosing the right insurance plan and signed me on within 20 min. It felt like I was speaking to a very well-informed friend. 

My baby is insured and it was a none tedious experience. ",5
"I have been a Dotsure client since May 2017 and I have had absolutely NO reason to change insurers.  I have added on a 2nd vehicle this year and their premiums are unbeatable!!  I have had no hassles with affordability, especially taking into account that I had recently been retrenched.  Dotsure still ensured that there were no premium increases during these difficult times that we are currently facing. Not to forget - my client services consultant, Lindisipho Qaqawe - is absolutely awesome!! Dotsure, I am hooked!!  Extremely pleased to be a Dotsure customer.",5
I forgot that Hollard sent me a message that they are merging with dot sure and when the debit order went off I was upset wondering how a pet insurer deduct money from my account. I realised my mistake after I stopped the debit order a few days later and sent an e mail to dot sure who promptly called me and sorted out the debit order issue fast. Very fast and efficient customer service.,5
"Was with Hollard, and with merge I was unsure, however, after my first encounter with the dotsure staff I was convinced that I would stay on and continue my policy. Thanks for your friendliness and being helpful - good job and I Iook forward to being a dotsure client for life.",5
Requested changes to be made on my policy and Cindy Mabukane assisted me really fast with excellent service,5
"Had an issue regarding an extra debit that went off my account. Logged a query the evening late, and 1st thing the next morning I was contacted by Matassja Fourie, who assisted, and rectified the mistake immediately. The refund was in my account the next morning. 
Very friendly and efficient staff all round!!!!! ",5
Nicky was very nice and ensured I understood everything. It was a pleasure communicating with her. ,5

Caitlyn Kelton Is the most amazing consultant. Not did she understand my problems that I‚Äôm facing but she managed to sort out something that is suitable now. If I could I would only want her to manage my account. If you ever want to talk to a consultant ask for  Caitlyn Kelton. ,5

You looking for a good insurance company, i'd highly recommend Dotsure!",5
"Having policy transferred from Hollard to Dotsure was such a breeze. Needless to mention working with Dotsure team on a claim on my Motor Warranty Plan was Effortless. It all started with Engine making a Scary Tick-Tick >then> Silence (dead)

Visiting Dotsure Website, Jo-Ann asked How can I help? Claim logged in less than 1 minute. Once documents provided - Demi took Over, and Kim finalized everything in 2 business days with money in bank to pay for repairs. Thank you Dotsure team.  A Scary Tick-tick, became a wonderful Vrrrpha !!! ",5
I dealt with Rebecca van der Breggen this morning and she was absolutely charming and understanding and I so appreciate the sentiments she expressed to me about the loss of my adored and beloved dog.  She's a credit to your company.,5

"Justin Jafta was a great consultant. Thoughtful, detailed and polite. ",5
"I was in formed by email, that Dotsure would be taking over Hollard Insurance and it's clients.  I recently received a phone call, welcoming me to Dotsure.  While chatting to the very pleasant lady, I mentioned that I had been insured with Hollard for more than twenty years.  She asked me if I was happy with their service - which I said I was - but that as a Pensioner, who now does very low monthly mileage - it would be great if my Vehicle Insurance Premiums could be reduced.  The lady said she would pass on my request to their Assessment Department - and they would soon give me a call.  Approximately twenty minutes later, my phone rang, and it was Dotsure phoning to tell me that they had reassessed my situation, and that my Insurance Premium would be substantially reduced, with immediate effect !!  
I was truly impressed with their very quick response, plus appreciative of their empathy - particularly for a struggling, older person !!",5
"A pleasure to deal with, Jaen from Pets department was extremely professional, spoke clearly and was not forceful to sell or sign me up but rather helpful and explained everything, how it should be. Will definately recommend dotsure.co.za to anyone looking for pet insurance. Thank you Jaen, hope you get a nice little bonus, Dotsure should be proud to have you. :) ",5
Excellent service from Kate Heigen and from Dotsure. So impressed so far!,5
"By far the most flexible and affordable insurer I've come across. Built my own comprehensive cover, and I've claimed for a windscreen, which was absolutely painless. Super friendly support staff, too. I'll stay with Dotsure for many years to come. ",5
"Great , fast service, No problem at all and claims are super fast. Staff isalso super friendly.",5
"<div>Dotsure took over from Hollard and my debit order was deducted on 30th July, instead of 1st August, putting my account into overdraft.  I sent a letter to Dotsure and within 45 minutes was phoned with an explanation that when the 1st of the month was on a Sunday the debit order was deducted two days earlier.  It was agreed that the debit order will be deducted on the 3rd of the month in future.  I was very impressed with the speed of the response.</div>",4
<div>Thank you Palesa for helping me join Dotsure. Such excellent  service. Please call me back so I can get a quote for my dad</div>,5
"Recently I had a tyre burst on a busy freeway during peak hour traffic. It was a scary experience, having to manage my vehicle in such dangerous conditions, with my two frightened and shocked kids on the back seat. I made a quick call to a friendly operator at Dotsure, who took the time to assess the safety of the situation and calmly gave me instructions to follow while taking down my location. Within 18 minutes, a flatbed tow truck arrived and hoisted my vehicle, and got me and my family home safely. To my surprise, soon after, I received 2 follow-up calls both for Dotsure and the towtruck company to enquire if we were sorted. Thank you to all involved for the brilliant service.",5
ABSOLUTELY THE BEST.Will refer them anytime,5
Excellent value for money,4
"I'm saying great - so far!  I have not had a claim as yet and don't want one!
I was with Regent/Hollard for decades and was very angry that they passed over their personal lines insurance to Dotsure.  I had never heard of Dotsure.
However, so far, dealing with the admin and queries relating to the transfer to Dotsure, things do seem to be going very wellI hope it continues this way if I have a claim.  ",5
Was assisted by Bernadine Bence to obtain insurance for my african grey. Excellent service thank you. Keep up the good work ,5
"I lodged a claim on the 20th July 2021 and it was finalized within 24 hours, money paid into my account and all. Thank you so much Dotsure for the efficient service ?",5
I was involved in a motor accident on 15th June 2021.  I submitted my claim timeously.  I was only notified on 9th July that the claim was finalised.  It took a further two weeks for them to notify the panel beater that they could go ahead.  Not acceptable.,1
"The best service I have ever received from an insurance company! If you are not with Dotsure, you're losing out. Friendly and reliable service at a very affordable rate. Thank you Dotsure!",5
"I did my research, covered my puppy with the Superior plan and both cats with Accident cover. Added the excess booster.
Et voila.
Their service is quick and hassle-free. My vet has their forms ready for me to fill in and so far I got everything back. 
Another plus for me: They also include third party liability, which is a must for me.

Just realized that it also includes: Flea and deworming treatment AND nail trimming!! Now I'm actually laughing - I really did the right thing here :))",5
Staff is very friendly. My only problem is that my premiums got to be too high when I changed from personal to business (taxify) policy. I could not afford anymore. ,3
"Recently switched my car insurance to dotsure as my friend recommended them and the service has been excellent so far, so helpful and quick with assistance. Will highly recommend dotsure",5
"Hi firstly this company is new to me before and Hollard insurance should be included into this review because they service was awesome and delivered according to their promises. Going back to Dotsure firstly time for waiting on the phone was very short and i was speaking to a consultant by the name of Acona he assisted me but our line got disconnected. He went the extra mile to call me and to conclude my equery. Thank you for that.

"I've been with Dotsure for 5 years and I remember my 1st claim in 2016 for an accident that happened in Polokwane yet I stay in JHB. After reporting the incident to SAPS and sending them the claim documents it took 2 hours for the claim to be finalised compared to my former insurer Discovery that almost killed me with stress refusing for a month to settle a legit claim. Love Dotsure so much that I've recommended them and 5 of my friends have signed up and are all happy. 

Thank you DOTSURE!!!!",5
"I have been with Dotsure now for 5 years.  Since inception to the last claim, I have been satisfied with the efficiency in processing the claims and the absolute friendly and professional service one received from the staff.

The service is great and the price of the premiums are so reasonable compared to other Insurance companies. ,5
Dotsure was excellent in the quotation and finalization of my insurance. They sent me all the documentation before the call ended and followed up to check if they had covered all the bases. They really went the extra mile to ensure that I felt comfortable and that the cover was tailored to my needs. ,5
Good until you change something. Then you get quotes that are massively inflated,2
Never had any issues with them. Been with Dotsure over 7 years now and very happy with the service and monthly fees!,4

"I have logged a claim on my maintenance policy MTRG**********. My policy schedule documents and emails bare th4 name of dotsure. Ayoob the idiot from claims department has wasted my time and airtime for the last 5 days asking for service documents. I have sent him all the documents I have and the emails explaining why my last service was delayed. I have been calling and emailing Clyde and Pam who assisted me last December when my service claim was refuted by the same idiots at the claims department. I am being sent around between dotsure, warranty solutions and mother financial, emails and phone calls all ignored. All 3 of these companies are useless crooks. It is clear that their modus operandi is to reject claims and frustrate their clients which exhausting and taxing on one's mental health. They don't care. All I want is for someone like Pam to resolve this claim urgently before I resort to posting on social media before I open a legal case and sue them. ",1

"Wonderful service from Charlize Minnaar, you can hear the passion in her voice.",5
"I had insurance with them for two pets.  I wished to cancel my policy since one of my pets have passed away and I would rather regularly set money aside for my other pet than make use of insurance as she rarely requires veterinary attention and is not a dominant reactive or aggressive type of dog who will easily bite another dog or person.  I made my request for cancelation of the whole policy very clear to their conservation specialist (someone who tries to get you not to cancel - I used to work in this field, so I know the tricks of the trade).  Today I received an amended policy for only my remaining pet.  This is unbelievably unethical and dishonest - either from the side of the person trying to convince me to stay or from the cancellations department.  I made it clear that I wanted to CANCEL THE ENTIRE POLICY FOR BOTH PETS.  In my previous position as conservation specialist I would never have been paid for this, as this is not a true conservation, but a criminal and dishonest act going against the client's specific instructions. (I'm also an admitted attorney, so they have really barked up the wrong tree.)  If this is how you do business, I am staying away from your company for good and I will definitely not be shy to share my experience with all my friends looking to obtain pet insurance for their pets.",1
Great assistance from Kadhija Khan. Now me myself and my dogs can rest assured. Thanks,5

Have been a customer since 2006 and had cover since then on my household and vehicles. Have had minor claims like windscreen etc on about 3 occasions. Recently had a claim of under R5000 due to a 3rd party hitting into me. Although Hollard was going to be reimbursed by 3rd party they refused to pay out. ****py service. Staff members also have very bad work ethic. Not the cheapest insurance so avoid Hollard many other better insurance companies out there with better service and better products with better rates. So no need at all to use Hollard.,1
Jodi Muller assisted me in signing up with dotsure. Jodi was very professional and friendly.,5

"This is the 2nd time I've attempted claiming from Dotsure,and both of my experiences have been stressful and drawn out. Having to claim means that something bad has happened to my dog which is a stress in itself and to add to that - trying to submit a claim and communicate with dotsure & the vet. What a complete nightmare it has been and I am so tired of going through this. Considering closing my insurance with dotsure as it has not been of any help through this trying time, and after nearly 2 weeks i have not got any closer to submitting a claim. Dotsure claim to have your claim submitted and sorted and paid within a day or few hours and i have yet to experience service like that. So frustrated.  ",1
I continue to recieve appauling service from Dotsure and noone from this insurance is taking the initiative to get things in order. If I do not call to follow up noone will call me to give me an update. It's a mess,1

"Dotsure consultant, Michaela Cronje, is possibly the friendliest, most efficient person you could possibly find. She responded to my claim within 2 hours of submission and contacted me personally the next day to inform that the claim has been processed. Her friendly and helpful demeaner is a testament to her professionalism. It was a pleasure to be supported by her.",5
"Jodi Muller was extremely professional and continued to explained all options in detail for my pets. I have received brilliant and very efficient service from her. In my personal opinion, I think that she is very well spoken and exceptionally knowledgeable of the full product range being offered by Dotsure. In my opinion, she deserves to get a good commission as I had very little time to read through the contract that she sent me but she had the ability to explain 3 different options and eventually I chose the options most suited for me and signed up immediately.

"I was on Hollard and then transfered to Dotsure without my consent, this was the worst mistake Hollard made. Dotsure offers pathetic service and when the speak to you on the phone, they are not apologetic. When you ask for the supervisor they tell you that the person does not exist. The contractors they use are not professional at all. I have had the worst experience ever with Dotsure in the two months that I have been with them. I can never recommend this insurance to anyone. A home emergency is only attended to after 8 hrs of registering the case.",1
Charlize Minnaar is an excellent brand ambassador and assisted me with everything that I needed. Thank you so much and may you continue to shine the light of DotSure bright.,5

"Last month i reported the bad service I get from DOTSURE and was hoping they will change but guess what, they did the same **** like last month, over debited my account with R950 which they claim it‚Äôs the Admin fee, nobody ever mentioned that to me, last month they over debited but I got my refund and suddenly now they say they took R950 I owe them for admin fees which to me it‚Äôs a hidden cost since it was never mentioned to me, and it dsnt make sense why I got a refund if I owe them R950. Spoke to a very rude guy by the name Linda Sipho who called me today and did not even want to listen to my query, if anyone knows a great company that knows how to treat customers well and are not doing as they wish into customer‚Äôs accounts and has no hidden costs please refer me. DOTSURE is nonsense, very unprofessional, rude agents especially that idiot Linda Sipho, if DOTSURE knows their business they have to do something with that guy, they only supposed to take a total of R1500 for my premiums on the 22nd as agreed, to my surprise they went in on the 20th and took R950 which I don‚Äôt know about referenced as DOTSURE fee. I am very unhappy with this abuse I get from this Company and I will write also to the ombudsman . I don‚Äôt know what the manager‚Äôs do in this company if we are being treated like this. You will never even get an apology for a bad treatment by an agent from the manager ",1
"D'Angelo was very friendly and helpful. He explained the insurance policy with patience and spoke very clearly and understandably over the phone, which can be difficult to do. I would recommend speaking with him if you have any queries. ",5

Becca was baie behulpsaam en vriendelik. Sy't alles mooi verduidelik en die proses baie maklik gemaak. ",5
"If there was a 0 rate I‚Äôd give them 0, their service is very bad that I wonder why they still have clients, it‚Äôs almost 3 months now since I‚Äôve logged a claim and it seems like I‚Äôm still gonna wait forever. Every time I contact them the person is either sick or out of the office. Apparently they have only one assessor, an entire big insurance company with one assessor, what a disaster!!!!",1
"Jaen Boshoff was equally friendly and informative. 

I'm a first time insurance buyer, so naturally, I didn't really know what to expect. However, by the end of our call, my fur baby was covered (budget friendly) and I had complete peace of mind. I would 10/10 recommend her to a friend! ",5
Mazibulo Myo was incredibly helpful. He was really friendly and answered my ignorant questions so patiently. ,5

"I would give Dotsure pet insurance 0 stars if it were an option. I've had the worst experience with this insurance company and will be cancelling my policy as soon as I am done here. I have been waiting almost three months for my claim to be resolved with no success. My animal was ill and needed medical attention, I sent all necessary information to the consultants more than once and they are still ""reviewing"" my claim.  I had to get a motivational letter signed by the vet and that still wasn't enough, they pestered the vet to confirm the diagnosis once again, which he did, and that was still not enough! The consultants are ignorant about the animals they offer insurance for, making the claim process impossible, because they do not know what counts as cause for concern when it comes to reptiles and exotics nor are they familiar with the illnesses that afflict them, therefore do not know what counts as an illness. I am paying for the premium plan with Dotsure but got subpar service from the consultants and managers alike, I always have to call them back to find out the progress of my claim, the consultants reassure me that my claim will be handled and a consultant will call me to provide feedback, but I never receive that call back and I have to call and speak to a new consultant all over again because the person I spoke to previously is ""unavailable"". Based on my experience, I am convinced this company runs on bubbly personalities and nothing more.  ",1
"Efficient, timeous and friendly service is to be recommended. Claims processed in a matter if a few hours. ",5
"Terrible.  My vehicle was stolen and recoved.  send to SAPS Impound.   at the impount the vehicle was moved around using a forklift and sustained so major damage.   DOT sure suspected me of submitting a false claim for damages.  Vehicle was sent for mechanical repair at a panelbeating company instead of the Agents.  panel beating company used second hand parts and aftermarket parts to repair.  vehicle was retuned 2 month later not running properly and returned.  After reporting DOT sure to the ombudsman, there claim was settle after 4 months of being in repair.  I was still instructed to settle the vehicle tracking  contract despite the vehicle being written off.  the tracking company has been hounding since stating i am responsible for the full settlement.  CIVIL case pending with DOT sure.",1

"Very very impressed with Dotsure. I have only been a client since the 1st of July this year . Unfortunately my fur baby Phoebe had a little accident on Friday 16 July where I had to take her to an after hours hospital, she stayed the night and was well taken care of. On Monday 19 July I submitted my claim, I got a call from Stacey Lee Masimela the same day advising that she's busy processing my claim. Later that day I received another call to advise that my claim has been paid and should be in my account within 2 - 3 days. Now this is absolute the best service I have ever received from an insurance company in months. Thank you Dotsure for making the process so easy and convenient.",5

"Very disappointed with my first experience claiming with dotsure after moving from semi-capable Hollard. Submitted all required documentation and have been waiting a week for an answer on my vehicle warranty claim. You cant get through to the vehicle warranty team, only motor vehicle accident team. Customer service is really good all advisors are friendly but can only say what the previous advisor said 'The claim is being processed'. Sent an email and still no reply after 72hrs. asked for it to be escalated, I was then told it will be escalated to a manager who will then escalate it to an assessor and then I assume after that it will be escalated to God for a final review. 7 days and you get the same answer you get on day 1 = Nothing.",1
"
With it been my first time having to obtain pet insurance, I had done an online inquiry and was immediately contacted by Gabriella Julies. She had taken her time to explain the various options available and assist to what best suits my fur baby's. Whilst in the process of shopping around, Gabriella also sent me an email on what to look out for when comparing with other insurers which really helped when making the final decision. This lady sold me to the brand and provided me with world class service. Well done Gabriella and keep up the good work. RECOMMENDED 5 stars  ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê

Whilst in the process of shopping around, Gershwin also sent me an email on what to look out for when comparing with other insurers which really helped when making the final decision. This gentleman sold me to the brand and provided me with world class service. Well done Gershwin and keep up the good work. ",5
Waseem Esaack helped me set up a policy for my new puppy. He was professional and friendly amd took the time to explain everything to me. Awesome service.,5
Always the best service when dealing with Dotsure but Megon Andrews was absolutely fantastic on Friday! I submitted a claim at 5pm on Friday afternoon and by 5:30 my claim was processed and refund was in my account! They aren't like your usual insurance company who always tries to find an excuse not to pay out... just a breath of fresh air and fantastic! ,5
Tamlyn Mostert was amazing and so efficient! Everything was sorted so super fast.,5
