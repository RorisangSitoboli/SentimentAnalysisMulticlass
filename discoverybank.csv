"The final straw has been a significant payment due to me (which was done on the 18th Feb), still not reflecting as at today (25th Feb). Upon calls to the agents they indicate I need to submit POP. I get the payer to do so, via a sms which I send to the discovery email address. They are unable to resolve with this, and must have a PDF. But why?? Anytime you do a POP you have an option to select a sms, or email notification? So why now need a PDF when all details are on the sms? In any event, the agent then tells me it will take 10 working days. What rubbish, when require funds now, and it is not my fault. I also need to state that when the person attempted to do the transaction on their own, they could not, even with the ACCOUNT NUMBER provided. Their banker had to do it. This is absolutely horrible, and the last of many disappointments. Will be switching accounts.",1
"Worst bank I've dealt with (I have accounts at Standard, FNB, Nedbank).
Contrary to their advertising, Discovery Bank's credit card interest rates are higher than other banks.
They force you to use the phone app, which frequently crashes or connection is unavailable. Functions are obscure/ not intuative.
My advice - avoid Discovery Bank, rather stay with any of the big four banks.",1
"So apparently ""Missing"" Forex Payments are a norm with #DiscoveryBank

4 Clients in came in with the exact same issue.

10hrs + on phone, 2 bank visits and no one has answers.",1
It's been a week since I sent proofof payment spoken to Kabeko R and to Bathabile who both did not log a query until I spoke With Kagisi who did log a call and gave me the queelry number. However it's again 48 hrs since and still have it heard from them.,1
"My complaint is around the so called Discovery iPhone Benefit!! In January 2022 I activated this ""benefit"". So on 11/01/2022 I purchased the phone from the iStore, resulting in an amount of R15 000 being taken off my straight facility by Discovery Bank. This is because I did not have a budget facility.

On 13/01/2022, I made an EFT of R15 000 into the Discovery Credit card, settling the full amount owing on the credit card.
In February 2022, I was shocked when Discovery Bank debited my straight facility by an amount of about R780. I am not sure what this is for because I do not owe Discovery anything. As I paid for the phone in full. The only expectation I have is to receive the refund.
I have called trying to resolve this matter, but no one at the bank is willing to assist.
As my attempts to get answers and get my money back from Discovery Bank have not been ignored by Discovery, I will be escalating this matter to the Prudential Authority.",1
"On the 22 February 2022 at about 09h05 I missed a call from dsv courier **********) I tried returning it and spoke to someone called Nkolizi I told her that I was returning a call as well as expecting delivery of my bank card. 
She insisted that I provide a reference number before being assisted. I tried informing her that there's no message or sms so I won't have any reference. We then had a stalemate since she wants a reference number of which I don't have. Discovery bank contracted this incompetent company and I'm questioning myself if I should bank with them when getting a bank card is such a nightmare.",1
"Absolutely love my banking experience here. Signing up is a few clicks away, this bank really puts its weight behind healthy banking habits. If you are on your way to financial banking freedom, I highly advise you look at discovery. They have by far the best banking app, the most interactive money saving/investment guide. Great tracking of your net worth and the best rewards system. With healthy spending you earn back your Vitality Money monthly premium. If you are lucky enough to afford to have all your products in-house with them then you will derive 100% value back on all your vitality products.",5
"Called this morning regarding fees on my account. The first agent was clearly working from home with a bad connection and couldn't hear me well. Then she couldn't hear me at all for some reason. So I had to put down... Why didn't she call back if she had my details? I then called m again and spoke to Mini who hardly understood my basic questions and really wasn't clued up. A most frustrating experience... Not the type of service I expect from a 'premium bank'
I'd like a team leader/supervisor to call me asap",2
"First of all, I had to select a star, they don't deserve a single one. Charged me the exact amount twice and refuse to refund my money. I've spoken to over 10 incompetent consultants that all say 'it's been escalated to the relevant department' a division without communication. 5 days waiting for them to fix this problem and nobody has the decency to own up to the stupidity nor send some sort of feedback. I'm appalled by their service and overall support, lack of really.",1
"You go online to apply for credit card, then they call you, and at point blank you get declined. They dont give a reason as to why what so ever.
You must apply for credit to build ur credit score but get declined when you want to get credit.",1
"According to Discovery Bank's website and App, when a customer refers someone to Discovery Bank both you and the person being referred can receive up to 5,000 Discovery Miles. After moving to Discovery Bank about a year ago, which led to me moving to Discovery Medical Aid, Vitality and Insure, I referred two of my family members to join Discovery Bank using my referral code.

My one family member joined Discovery Bank using my referral code and opened a Gold Transactional Account. Following their first transaction, neither of us had received any Discovery Miles. I logged a query with Discovery Bank regarding this and have not received any feedback.

Subsequent to this, I referred another family member who also used my referral code to join, however, they were not sure which colour account (Black or Platinum) they wanted to open, so they proceeded in just opening a savings account until they could contact Discovery Bank. They did this to ensure that all the steps and time they had completed on the app was not lost when they continued their application the next day.

Discovery Bank then informed them that again, neither of us would be receiving the Discovery Miles, since the savings account that they had opened, was not a qualifying product. As much as I understand this, I think it is very sly of them to deny clients the benefit of a referral just because someone wanted to make sure which product they wanted to open.

If this is the type of service provided by Discovery Bank and Discovery as a whole, I will be sure to move back to my previous bank and make sure to tell my family members to do the same. This is a pathetic lack of care and customer service. Having such a big portfolio with Discovery Bank and seeing that my family member wanted to open a Black Bank Suite, one would expect Discovery Bank to be accommodating to ensure they provide the best customer service from the start, but they have really shown that they don't care about customer service and that they don't value customers with a significant portfolio of products with Discovery. 

VERY DISSAPOINTED!",1
"My monthly automatic digital subscription payment to a US newspaper has been declined four days in a row on my credit card.  I have contacted Discovery Bank via telephone (the only option) on three occasions.  The first time, after explaining the issue, I was left on hold for over ten minutes and then cut off.  On two further occasions I told the agent that the transaction was legitimate and that it must please be authorized.  I received an email explaining that there was a system failure on a specific day and I should try again.  That was a lie as the transaction has been declined on each of four days.  None of the agents knew why the transaction had been declined and had to refer it to a different department.  The last agent said she would escalate the problem.  However, the transaction continues to be declined.  So no luck getting the call centre to sort out a simple case of a legitimate transaction being declined, and clearly a waste of time spending more air time complaining through the only channel available.  Discovery Bank has by far the worst customer service I have ever experienced from a bank and this is just the most recent bad experience.  They are all bells and whistles yet light on the basics.  That’s the opposite of what a bank should be.",1
"Last year Novermber I disputed a debit order and was told because it is older than 40 days it has to go to a different  department and they will try recover my money. Today 3 months later I'm still waiting for some sort of response! I have called a number of times and no one can tell me what is going on, I constantly get ""I will call you back as I have escalated it to the Manager"" I have spoken to about 7 different consultants and non of them are able to assist me. This is the reason why I have left your bank - little to no service and consultants that don't assist.",3
"I applied for a Credit Card through the Discovery Banking App a couple of days ago, submitted all the relevant documentation and received an email as well as a SMS that the application was approved and that I had to accept it on the application.  When logging into the application on my cell nothing was available to be accepted.  Called Discovery Bank and spoke to a consultant in the Credit Department that advised me that there was a technical glitch that they can see needs addressing and that it would be resolved within 24 hours.  Upon checking today it is still not resolved.  Called them now only to find out that even after promising to resolve the issue they actually went ahead and closed the application and that there was nothing pending on my profile.  REALLY????? How can they promise one thing and then do something completely differently.  I am disgusted and livered with this.  As far as I am concerned I would love to know what they Banking Ombudsman would say about this when they listen to the phone recording and find that the consultant lied to me.  They even gave me the limit that I was approved for etc.  If I did not want the card then why would I apply, why would I bother to call twice to find out what is going on etc.  They are truly questionable and I think this speaks volumes for the reasons why so many people have expressed their frustration on this platform with this institution.  Wish I had checked on this before I even bothered to apply.

Oh and by the way, if you request to speak to a manager they simply inform you that the managers do not take calls and that you have to basically stand with your hat in your hand awaiting their urge to communicate to be big enough to grace you with their presence on a telephone call.  REALLY?????",1
I am so annoyed with Doscoverys credit application process and the fact that the customer care line has no idea how to support clients. I have been offered a credit limit of R250k for my credit card with FNB yet Discovery finds that because I am a freelancer that I cannot apply for a credit limit of more than R1. Whether this is because they are their hardest not to ‘reward’ discounts (I need to have a credit limit to have a certain suite to receive discounts) I don’t know. My question now is why I cannot then be on the Keycore health plan and pay less if my income proof is not sufficient for a proper credit limit? I was told to open a transaction account on my portfolio to achieve the suite months ago and all that’s happened is that I’ve been paying an extra R10 every month to DB. I am so sick of this BS.,1
"I withdrew money from an ATM on 09 Feb 2022 and came up with an error message transaction failed I tried it 3 times I hope that it was a mistake and no money was received. To my surprise looking at my app transaction, the money was deducted even though I never received it. I emailed *********** on 10 Feb 2022 no feedback to date. I have reviewed one transaction that was reversed the other two are still pending ATM reversals.",1
"Unfortunately, there is not a lower star than 1, as this describes my experience with the bank.
I am struggling to open an account for months now. My first advisor disappeared after I filled in all my documents. I have then been in contact with another person who asked me to download the app. I did, and then my application expired for no reason after I accepted all T's & C's. I then phoned them and reapplied for a bank account, this morning I received an SMS stating I need to log into the app to view the quote and accept it when I access the app, it just tells me ""Congratulations, you have submitted all your documentation"" and logs me out immediately. I had it with Discovery. I should rather take my business elsewhere.",1
"Good Morning 

May I ask for direction/help on how to get assistance in having access to my mobile banking app. After inserting my credentials, it takes me to the log in option screen and stops there. I need to make urgent transfers today but i can not. 

I have since been struggling with this bank, sending emails back and fro and im still struggling till to this day. The card was blocked due to a fruad case on it, however no replacement card was sent to me or advise for me to open a new account, they just blocked it and left me like that. When i need money i struggle a lot, its so sad.

Is there perhaps a branch i can visit for assistance in getting a new card as my card and the only way i get funds from it is by transferring all my money into a different account, imagine the admin there monthly. 

Your assistance is greatly appreciated.

Kind Regards
Pheletso Sepane",2
Fica hold placed on my account I then manually sent the documents. I'm told I need to upload on the website there should be a pop up when I login of which this is not there I have tried different browsers. Lots of money spent calling the bank since Saturday and no assistance now on 3rd day no access to my funds.,1
"I was retrenched, and had to find out Discovery Bank was the ONLY bank with no credit. Insurance to tide me over till I could pay. They offer no reduced settlements either. I cannot even get my settlement amount out of them to close this account and get rid of them. They do not even have email!",1
"You guys have a long way to go. I do not have any issues with FNB.
I did everything to unlock my password. Resetting it, you name it.
Still when I try to login with the  temporary password, it still tells me my account is locked. Geee Wizz...I am going to close this account as soon as possible.",1
I joined Discovery Bank last year and was promised 500 discovery miles upon joining. Its now been a year and still waiting for it to be loaded onto my account. I have called many time and Discovery always have another excuse. I have been promised to be called back but that has never happened. If this is not resolved by the end of the month I will be closing both mine and my wife's discovery accounts.,1
I made n payment of R1338 from my discovery account to a 3rd party (Vox telecom) and the payment did not reflect in there account  from 4th of December 2021 till today I have not received any feedback from discovery bank. I have my case number and all was send to the bank but no one can give me answers. I have spend more money on phone calls to discovery than I can say. I won't be using this bank ever again,1
"Compliment:

Thank you, Palesa.
You managed to put a smile on my face with the closure of one of my account's with Discovery Bank.
You guide me through it all, and you made sure all was done in the time frame you promised.

Keep it up, you're a 5 star employee! Everyone needs a Palesa in their life.",5
"My Discovery Bank app - stopped working yesterday morning.
I was asked to send screen shots and videos. 
3 emails and 3 follow up calls later and more than a day later - i am yet to hear back from Discovery Bank. not to mention i can't access my account to find out if there is a more serious problem.
Wow - i have all my financial services with Discovery. but clearly the Discovery Bank is not run by the same people. Most importantly my account being at risk does not seem to be a priority from them at all. appalling service",1
Discovery worst bank / wurst services and worst security . BE Wanted . You will loose your hard earned money in a flash,1
To I enjoyed world class service from Craig and Goitsimang at Discovery Bank thanks for making my process easy. South Africa needs to learn from you.,5
"I took out a transactional account with Discovery Bank when they launched in around 2019 as I had been with Discovery for over 10 years. I then kept the account but never used it because they were still new in the market and there were other functionalities I was still uncertain about so I did not switch fully to Bank. I called them a few days ago after getting a call from an agent wanting to offer me the same account, I called them to find out if I can resuscitate this account and give it a chance by switching my salary and day to day banking activities there to boost my vitality profile and to my surprise after not using this account for more than 2 years that I have an outstanding of R6000+ that I need to pay to Discovery before I can. I'm disappointed as a standing client of more than 10 years that an account that hasn't been used could owe that much, also what surprises me is that they were offering me the same account but when I resuscitate the account I'm told I can't use it till I pay R6000.",1
"Im trying to make a payment from Discovery Bank and I got a message that says “Discovery Bank: The EFT from account ***9565 to account ***7125 appears to be suspicious and has not been processed. For more info, call **********” I called the number 6 times and the agents keep hanging up the call. I need to make this payment today and there’s no help anywhere.",1
I had a Discovery credit card from the past (issued by FNB). This expired at the end of December and I chose not to renew it. Discovery continue to charge me monthly for an expired  credit card! I have emailed them to no avail and I do not want to get caught up in a dystopian call centre so the charges continue! As for a refund on charges......,1
Spent a hour on the phone with Discovery Bank to report a fraudulent transaction and they cannot assist immediately.  The transaction needs to be disputed and I need to wait for a dispute form to be sent to me via email.  Pathetic,1
"I am utterly disgusted at the lack of service from the fraud department, as this is the one department that should act promptly and efficiently. My client received a fraudulent proof of payment from a Bitcoin Scammer and I asked Discovery Bank to verify the authenticity of the payment in writing and they gave me a run-around for two days. After speaking to 5 different consultants I am still waiting for a response. As a result of their zero service delivery, my client lost R43 500 worth of Bitcoins to a fraudster and this is something that could have been easily prevented. Banks like FNB have on their website portal a tab available to verify payments and Discovery Bank is just behind with this technology. The consultants at Discovery should note that payment verification has nothing to do with the POPIA Act as personal information is not required (as this was the excuse they gave me). 
If Discovery Bank does not catch a wake-up, it will become a fraud haven which will ***** the image of the bank. As it stands I will never bank with Discovery, neither will I recommend it to anyone because this experience proves that my money will not be safe. Is Discovery even ready to be a bank?",1
"Most probably the most shocking service received from Discovery Bank. Credit Card expired the end of December 2021 and since struggling to get a new card ordered! After many calls and reference numbers, not even a call back. Shocking to say the least!",1
Discovery Bank Distribution Support. Thutho very professional and helpful and I would like to applaud his service.,5
"I redeemed my miles on Sunday using an in store voucher. The transaction was not successful.
I am still waiting for Discover bank to refund my miles with bo feedback communicated through to the customer providing an update",1
"Maybe I feel a little rejected, but I felt the need to point out my situation.

I am a 33 year old male, with a pre-existing health condition. (which is quite stable, and I'm actually very healthy in general, working out most days and following a healthy lifestyle) 

I was very keen to go the Discovery route with Vitality and change from FNB to Discovery Bank.
 
Because of my health condition which requires me to take blood thinners, I cant just change my medical aid, but I was advised I could take out a life policy from discovery, and then qualify for the vitality program. I was very excited, and even looked into getting Discovery Bank as well. 

Unfortunately my life policy application was rejected (after 2 weeks of poor communication - see my review on Discovery Life) 

This means, as a 33 year old, I wont ever be able to join Vitality health and thus, I dont see the point in changing my bank either as all these products go hand in hand. 

Disappointed, and frustrated, and maybe my feelings are a bit hurt. 
But this is probably how lots of clients wont make use of Discovery Bank.",2
"I was the victim of a scam on Saturday where large sums of money were transferred out of my Discovery Credit Card and Vitality Savings accounts. I logged the issue with Discovery within a few minutes and provided the required affidavit and case number later that afternoon. I have been following up for an update for the last 3 days but I keep being told I cannot speak directly to the investigator and they will contact me within their SLA of 72 hours.
I finally got a call from the investigator this afternoon and he offered no further information on the recovery of my money. He just said they waiting for the other banks. 
I honestly feel there is no sense of urgency being given to the matter and I am being told to remain patient while I am having sleepless night.",1
"I joined your bank because I thought you would be better than my previouse bank.
I slept with funds in my account last night. I woke up this morning with a R0 balance.
I'm starting to regret joining your bank. What should I do? Should I change banks again? I'm loosing out on my miles for a negative account. Please resolve this issue.
I cant be loosing money because of funds I have already spent just because they haven't been banked by the shop I bought from.",2
"I called Discovery Bank on the 11th of January to ascertain the reason for interest charges on my credit card. An Interest recon was sent via email with case number . The reason for the R169.22 could not be provided, and I was promised a call back the same day. I did not receive a call and called again the next day and was told I would be called back. I did not get call and called again today (17 January) for the third time and a new interest recon was emailed.  After spending 35 minutes on the phone the lady could still not explain the reason for the R169.22 which does not reflect on either of the recons. I was then transferred to someone else who did not answer the phone. The fact that I don’t get called back is an indication to me that they either don’t know or in fact charged me incorrectly. 

My concerns with the three interest amounts are:
1)	R169.22
To me appears that due to the interest hike on the 19th of November they charged me an additional amount to the R385.31, however, the R169.22 amount does not appear on the recons. If this is in fact for the change in interest rates, why was this not explained to me and why does it not reflect on the recons?

2)	R385.31
I always settle my credit card in full at the end of each month (I may have missed one or two in the last three years) and even though I paid the full balance at the end of October, and the minimum payment for November before the due date of the 4th, followed by the full balance on the 7th of December, I was still charged interest, so what happened to 55 days interest free?

3)	R90.01
Apparently, this was charged as I “lost my 55 days interest free” even though I paid the full outstanding balances on 7 and 31 December, and also take into account that according to me I was entitled to my 55 days interest free.

2022-01-10	Interest Charged at 15.00%				-90,01
2021-12-31	Payment - full December balance			19 826,00
2021-12-10	Interest Charged at 15.00%				-385,31
2021-12-10	Interest charged at 14.75%				-169,22
2021-12-07	Payment - full November balance			49 910,03
2021-12-01	Payment (minimum) for November			1 633,34
2021-11-02	Payment (additional) to settle October full balance	579,00
2021-11-02	Payment - full October balance				25 063,00
2021-10-04	Payment - full September balance			34 164,00

On the 17th of January I logged a complaint against DB with the Banking Ombud.  In line with their complaint resolution I received an email on the 19th stating that the complaint had been escalated to DB's internal dispute resolution dept.

On the 21st of January I received this email from DB:

Hope Munodawafa <***********>
Fri, 21 Jan, 15:44 (12 days ago)
to me

Good Day Mr Bosman

I am reaching out to you regarding a complaint we received from the Ombudsman for Banking Services regarding the various interest charges on your credit card account.

Firstly, I sincerely apologise for the frustration and inconvenience caused to you in this regard. This is not the level of service we strive to provide to our clients and will try our very best to ensure this does not happen again.

Please note that we are currently investigating your query with the relevant teams and will revert with feedback as soon as possible.

 I followed up with Hope on the the 26th of January via email but received no response which means that this ""is the level of service we strive to provide to our clients and will try our very best to ensure this happens again."" 

It has now been 3&1/2 weeks since my original call and a week since I followed up with an Executive Relationship Manager and DB is still unwilling to provide me feedback on my interest charges. 

DB sent an email to me last week warning me to be careful of fraudsters yet the very same ""bank"" has potentially overcharged me (which is also fraud) and unwilling to provide me with feedback?",1
"Absolutely shocked at the services recieved as a discovery client, i have been charged on a canceled card for a transaction, i have been trying to contact discovery i have spoken to agents who were very unhelpful and didnt even know how to go abojt handling the situation. I spoke to a manager named Marushka who was the most unprofessional person i have ever spoken to, she informed that she doesnt know whats going on and that the case is with the disputes team, which i have emailed myself and havent recieved any response from. The card was cancelled but payments are still going of the account, i will definitely be contacting the obssa with my complaint as even the staff at discovery bank is incompetent",1
"This is my first ever public review of any company. I want to be clear, I never applied to become a Discovery Banking customer but was forced into dealing with this company as I had a discovery credit card underwritten by FNB.
I have been a long standing Discovery Health, Discovery Life customer and have a Discovery Credit Card. I have been trying since November 2021 to close this credit card account. Discovery Bank is either incredibly incompetent or willingly ignorant in closing my account. 
Today I have just wasted another 48 minutes of my life achieving absolutely nothing through the Discovery Call centre. Apparently I now have a third request to close the account and also a dispute logged with Discovery Bank. The previous two requests I received and paid settlements for and also send proof of payment. Today, I asked for confirmation via email of my dispute, agent said they are not authorised to provide this. I asked to speak a manager I was told managers are not available. I have made a video/audio recording as proof of my discussion. Although I can turn to social media I am hoping this might be an alternative as I am at my wits end. In 20 days I can log a request with the ombudsman as I followed all processes and are now fed up with this company.
If Discovery Bank cannot even resolve a small issue like closing an account, I do not trust them with any further matters related to my finances. Additionally this has left a really bad perception for me about the group and I will be extremely cautious to consider any additional products from Discovery.",1
"I like the whole Discovery concept. However I am disappointed in the bank. I short if you dont qualify for a credit card you pitty stuffed. No nothing under all rewards it indicate - ""your current bank product doesnt qualify for this benefit"" eg Woolworths, Clicks, Uber, BA/Kulula Emirates ect, Pick and Pay, Dis-Chem, Sportmans Warehouse. No iPhone or iWatch either. Whats the point in joining? I dont want a CC. I did apply for package to get the rewards, but I dont qualify no surprise here. Point is think before you open an account realise if you dont qualify for CC there is no benefit. Nedbank still give me a better banking experience. I will revert back to Nedbank.",1
"I love Discovery, but Discovery Bank has been so disappointing. 
I had a Discovery CC ( FNB) for years and when discovery bank opened my credit card was transferred. But at that stage they opened a bank account for me too - which since 2019 I have been trying to close and get a credit for all the bank fees! I have called many times and in 2019-mid 2020 was told they didn’t have the functionality to just close the bank account and keep open the credit card. And was advised that when it was available it would be done . Fast forward to 2022 -the bank account is still open and the fees are still accruing!  How can it be so hard for discovery to close this bank account? And credit all the bank fees?",1
"Very poor customer service!!! You hold for more than 6 minutes before your call is answered - then I request the consultant answered by the name of Paul to escalate to his manager so they manage the queue customers cannot hold for this long before service.

His answered was is that all that you were  calling for - so sarcastic and dropped my call when I told him he is being sarcastic instead of acknowledging my concern!",1
"I joined Discovery Bank a few weeks ago - 
The biggest mistake ever. Just ongoing problems from the start.
1. First payment I made to a pre defined beneficiary (by Discovery) the reference number just disappeared. (Cannot trust the banking App) Imagine the trouble sorting that out with a municipality that do not care about any service delivery to allocate the payment to the correct account.
2. Phoning the helpline - nightmare, pin after pin that you get to enter fail. Eventually when you speak to an agent the call drop- START OVER
3. Made a payment to new beneficiary using the web browser. Discovery blocked it ""appears to be suspicious"" - Same troubles over again with the helpline. Was informed to use the App, payment will be allowed. Payment was allowed.
4. This morning I was blocked from using the App on my phone because of that same payment I made after Discovery instructed me to use the App for the payment. Same helpline problems again sorting out the phone to get that unblocked.

It seems the banking system that Discovery use is very primitive. Bad processes at Discovery trying to cover for a lack of good security. I also do not like to be treated like some possible criminal by Discovery bank. Treat me with RESPECT - If YOU block sometime then please call me. Next time I call you will be to close my accounts. Block any payment or device again and I leave Discovery bank (all products) - If you have problem with a payment or device do the right thing- CALL ME FIRST!!!",1
"Poor service 😔,been on the phone since the morning today ,been calling and asking for assistance , was told they will call me back by two different consultants, wanted to register for a platinum cheque account, just called at again at 16:45 ,got the OTP number now the phone was dropped, not even one of the consultants honoured they're commitment to call me back at the time they suggested, my 1st time experience with discovery banking has to be the worse ,my number is **********",1
"Not a terrible bank I must be honest
 However
 They do almost next to nothing to help you recover money from fraud or scammers.
 Disappointing to know that they can't do much to help.",2
"This bank is the worst bank in the country, do not join them. The app does not work properly. The bank constantly says transfers are 'suspicious' and then forces you to phone into them to unblock the transfers. You phone through, wait 10 minutes, then explain your story, the customer service assistant then passes you through to fraud where you verify yourself again then you have to tell the whole story again, they then argue with you and tell you how great their bank is, then they pass you to someone else, then eventually they put the phone down on you. Do not bank with this company, they are awful!",1
"Discovery Bank cheats you out of your money. They promote their products with false information and only after you sign up for those and registration costs are incurred, they advise on T&C's. I regret joining Discovery Bank. Rather choose another bank that are upfront about their products. I still await their response to two calls made about this issue after more than two weeks. As long as they take from your account that is all that matters to them.",1
"Missed my credit card payment in November by +- 6 hours i.e. I settled the full payment amount 6 hours late. Only happened once before in the past 15 years. R466.71interest was levied on 15 November 2021 and another R355.42 on 15 December 2021. I accept that some penalty would be applicable but is it reasonable to be hit with a R822.13 penalty for paying in full 6 hours late ? Look at the big picture here, the history of your customer and the considerable business he has with you. This can't be right ! Latest correspondence after 1 week remains unanswered.",1
"My previous reviews refer .
I have had a payment arrangement with Discovery ever since Covid Enforced financial difficulties...
Literally every 2nd day since then (18 months) I receive an email, and an SMS reminding me to pay or I will be handed over. I have a debit order that goes through successfully EVERY month !!
After complaining about these messages , I was told its system generated ( always blame the system) and it cant be stopped. With the correct will, it could be. 
I decided to just ignore them and get on with my life.

Over the last couple of days / weeks, I have again realised what an annoyance this is, to be reminded EVERY 2nd day - of the financial difficulties I experienced and am working through during COVID.

Anyone at Discovery Bank consider the psychological impact this has ??",1
I have online banking details and need to make payment. I lost my phone and don’t have access to my app. I called the call centre to be told that nothing can be done I need to go buy a new smartphone. Even though I have access to my online banking. I was told that all online banking is good for is to view my profile and not transacting. So why have the page?,1
"I have literally been struggling to create an account for a year now. Every time I speak to someone there it is exactly the same thing.

Attempt to create an account on the App, get an error, take a screenshot, send it to them, get promised they will get back to me, never hear from them again. 

Literally the worst customer service I have ever had the misfortune of dealing with. The only reason I got a discover card is because it was linked to my FNB account, since they moved away from FNB and require users to use their app I have not been able to use that account AT ALL.

I don't know what to do anymore. Steer clear people. There is no hope here.",1
"To whom it may concern,

I would like to commend the service received from your team for all their efforts in resolving my issue. If all banks could be as efficient as Discovery Bank we wouldn't have to change banks at all. A special thank you to the team that was involved and the patience from all the agents(Pebetse & Sibongile) that answered my calls. It really gives me great joy to be part of Discovery. All the best to everyone and hope we grow even more in the future.

Kind Regards
Jeffrey",5
"I recently joined Discovery bank, moved my salary onto the bank and had my card delivered. after payday i struggled to make payment to service providers and withdraw money using my card because I'm unable to finalize the app transactions using their face recognition security application. I called the call center which indicated there is nothing they could assist with. What is mind blowing is that their is no other system they have in place or alternative should a client be in a position of not being able to conduct the selfie.  They have no branches for manual assistance nor do they have an alternative system in place to ensure I do not find myself having being stranded, having finances but unable to access them due to the institutions lack of systems.",1
"Its my 2nd time reporting this issue, but the ineffective system is still in tact.

My Vitality Money status dropped from Diamond to Silver because according to Experian my credit debt is R30 000.00. This is a totally wrong assumption to make because the credit report cut off was 31 Dec and the debt was paid off 10 days later.

This then reflect clients, high risk of debt which is not correct.
The 2nd problem is that this happens just before the February discounts are locked in, so I want this problem to be resolved within 4 days as I have proof that the debt was paid off long time back so there is no reason to PENALISE clients if experian draws incorrect conclusions.",2
"Absolute crooks, been paying off an overdraft for over a year and it just keeps increasing, instead of going down I owe more money. What a bunch of crooks.",1
"Still waiting for a merchant refund to clear. It’s more than 4 months. The merchant has refunded October, but Discovery doesn’t know where the money is.",1
"I submitted an instruction to cancel my credit card on the 29th of December with the plan to keep my bank account active.

It was never done.

So today I cancelled my whole account, since basic instructions cannot be carried out, but I have to wait 8 days now????

Do you guys understand you are blocking another account I am trying to open with another bank because you fail to follow a request?",1
"I called Discovery Bank on 20/1/2022 to report a problem with my credit card which isn’t working for purchases on Amazon. The consultant told  me he’d escalate the problem as it may be an internal issue and said I’d receive a response within two hours. After 24 hours, still NO RESPONSE. I called again on 21/1/2022 and that consultant also played the “escalation card” but she couldn’t even give an estimated time  or date of expected response. She also couldn’t explain properly how her alternative options worked. It’s now 22/1/2022 (48 hours later) and still NO RESPONSE. Very poor service indeed! If Discovery is not equipped to offer banking services they should rather stick to their areas of expertise.",1
"What an absolute pleasure

I'm definitely a happy customer and will recommend Discovery to anyone wanting to switch from the Big 5 

And when you sign up, use my ref code: QFS005",5
"Attempting a very small increase and Discovery Bank has an unbelievably slow turn around, was thinking of moving my FNB accounts over and quickly changed my mind. FNB offered me a huge pre-approved credit limit (1 hour turnaround if I accept) but went to Discovery and decided to rather increase existing credit card by very small amount for a reduction in interest rate. Still waiting on response, thank goodness I don't actually need the money or else I would be in a bind. I have been very disappointed by Discovery Bank since inception.",2
"I am still waiting for my Cheque card to be delivered.  Being in back to back meetings, I had no time to call the call centre between 8 and 5, why do you not have longer hours? When am I getting my card??",1
"The bank that changed every thing! I have been trying to get a credit card account closed since 5 Jan,2022. I tel & requested closing figures. I was told it takes 8 working days to close acc- they dont call Sat a working day.. I  cant believe this, I worked in a commercial bank for 31 years & it could be done the same day. I tel 3 times still same answer. 8 days after I received an e-mail with the closing balance R139.25. I paid it that day18 Jan, 2022. I thought now I would have a nil statement.. I checked on their website there was a bal of R2.38 on 19 Jan, 2022 so paid hat on that day. I checked to day 19 Jan, 2022 now say I owe R2.51. I will not pay this",1
"On 02 July 2021 I submitted a Fraud case to Discovery Fraud Department. I followed the process and filled out the forms and submitted all documentation. Since then I have been following up on the progress and spoke to the investigator a few times. Then it became quiet. Since my last submission of 8 August 2021, I have not received feedback, despite follow up e-mails from my side and calling the call center.

From the e-mails all I ever got was an automated message with a reference number and from the call center only empty promises of being called back and being e-mailed and assurances that the case has been escalated. 

17 January 2022 I called the call center again and was told by the agent that he would sent me an email with the reference number si I can go to the Ombud and with the contact details of the investigator. He also promised to have the investigator call me. No e-mail ... no phone call.

19 January 2022 I called the call center again, I then was told that the case have been closed months ago due to missing documentation. This is the first time I heard of this and I am livid. I never received official notice that the case is closed with a reason. In all the following up via e-mail and calling the call center this was the first time I was informed of this.

This is absolutely outrageous and the worst appalling level of service I have ever received from any company.",1
"I would not advise anybody to invest in Discovery fixed deposits. Getting your money out at maturity is challenging, in large part owing to not very effective staff, but also their very restrictive banking app. It has just taken me a week to get access to a fixed deposit that had matured, and then I still have to get their permission to up the daily limit (another 24 hours) before I can actually move the money back to my bank account. This is really pathetic. I will never do business with Discovery Bank again. I would rather put my money under the mattrass. If this is the best Hylton Kallner can do maybe he should move on.",1
"I don't have a credit card, but am continuing to be charged for one. Discovery refuses to resolve it, and will not contact me back.

What more can I do to resolve this Discovery?",1
I am in Saudi Arabia and struggling to contact them to close my account. After they moved from FNB it has been a struggle. Also my online account is locked. Just want to find out what was last interest. I also do not have a South African mobile nr anymore to fix the online lock issue. The struggle goes on :-(,3
With such a big reputation the service is pathetic. Waiting now almost 2 months for account to be confirmed and opened. Absolutely no response and no feedback. Won't recommend this bank to anybody and will put a full write up on social media regarding this.,1
"Discovery advertises that one gets 30% discount when using your miles on the 15th of the month. I have generated two vouchers on 2022/01/15 and could not use it at either Clicks or Dischem.
You need to either train your partners on how to process the discovery miles vouchers or stop advertising this as a benefit!",1
"Arrangements made with discovery, yet still being harassed by their attorneys. I made a payment into my Discovery Account and then wanted to transact from my Discovery account to pay another creditor but my account has been BLOCKED with no notice whatsoever so the little funds I have are trapped in my Discovery Transactional account. They do not reply to emails, they do not call back and they have trapped my only funds without notice and refuse to unblock my account. I’ve complained already about their disgusting attorneys on Hellopeter and they replied saying they would get back to me. THEY NEVER DID! I’m shocked and disgusted by the treatment and lack of service afforded by Discovery Bank.",1
"I would like to be contacted to discuss my possible move from Discovery over to Nedbank. This includes investments, car and household insurance, life policies and many others. Reasons will be given once I am contacted as I am now become frustrated and losing patience.",1
my problem still has not been resolved. i am the one begging for sercice and the i get charged. no one has even tried phoning me. instead i get sent a settlement letter,1
Worst experience ever. Stay away from this bank. I requested a debit order switch on October 20th. The debit order from Vitality was not moved over and they have now removed me from Vitality. I always have to contact them for assistance and they keep bouncing me from one department to another. Discovery as a company are frauds because even the 100% gym benefit that they advertise is flawed. Avoid this bank at all costs. Poor banking and customer service.,1
My investments are maturing. I left two instructions telephonically for my investments to be transfered at maturity. They failing to comply. I think they want to forcefully reinvest my money. I even have two ref numbers.they liers,1
"Since my wife's Discovery Card was moved to Discovery Bank, no one at the call centre was able to assist with getting her online banking profile setup and operational. Totally incompetent and useless resources!
Now, she has paid up the balance owing and called the call centre to close her account and once again, no one at the call centre is able to assist with this request. Totally incompetent and useless resources!",1
"I really don't enjoy resorting to social media and more often than  not, it's the only way that this totally disorganized bank seems to get the message.

REPLACEMENT CREDIT CARD

I HAVE MADE SIX CALLS IN TWO DAYS JUST TO REPAIR THE MESS REGARDING DELIVERY AND TO ACTIVATE THE CARD ~ WHICH IS STILL NOT DONE.

Respect for my time is zero and I just can't afford this incompetence

How this came out of Adrian Gore's stable of excellence is a total mystery and I have to wonder if Hylton Kallner is even aware of what the REAL customer experience is. 

Last time i had to contact him directly just to get a response. 
That did work!",1
"Discovery Bank have  being debiting my account with a card I do not possess. I have the following refernce numbers **********,**********,**********,**********,**********. Each time I call I get promised that I will be called back. I have now made 5 calls to the Discovery Call Centre and have not yet had a return call. I have not been able to get Discovery to stop the debit wqhich is now happening every month or to get these incorrect chartrges reversed.",1
Discovery bank has this amazing offering – but not one single consultant can tell me exactly what the offering consists of. I have had discussions with 8 different people on the same product and each person has told me something different. I have again requested a knowledgeable consultant to talk to me. It’s been days without Discovery bank making any contact. I can just image what it would be link if you become a client.,1
"I have now emailed 'Discovery card' / bank 12 times!!! I had a query. Eventually, i emailed them saying ' if you cannot have the courtesy to call me back, or email me, you can close my account. They emailed me back with instructions on how to close my account?!! They never bothered asking WHY?? It seems that Discovery bank are on a drive to irritate and ignore current customers! After a month of emailing, asking for a manager to contact me, i got a call from a consultant. I repeated that i wanted a manager to call me. 2
Two weeks later, i am STILL waiting!!! This month they double debited me for my card fees. Discovery bank must offer  the ABSOLUTE WORST customer service EVER!!!! I want to move my medical aid and bank account from Discovery!!!",1
"Credit Card ""Paused"" / stopped due to not responding to an email which was addressed to another person but to my email??? After three phone calls to Discovery's call center and speaking to a ""Banker""/ Manager, Peter Ditshego the only response was: ""We apologize for our errors (x3) and hear you but we can not do anything about it until our other department is able to sort it out"".  Their website was also not able to complete the required transaction as it had an error??? Not acceptable from a ""leading"" South African Bank. The fact that they offer one a Platinum Status also means nothing but ""sorry we can not help you now but we hear you"".",1
"When I was contacted to open the account the were quick to contact me, now that I want to close it no one comes back to me. I have hold on for hours, send mails and tried the website. I have a whole lot of nonsense transactions going off my account that I can not stop. Could someone please phone me to close this account",1
I am very happy with the service I received when applying for a credit card. The call center agents are extremely courteous and patient when asked questions. The card was delivered within a few days and there was continuous communication from the bank until the card was delivered. I am extremely happy! Looking forward to a lengthy relationship with this innovative bank. 10 stars!!,5
"I received a Bank Statement from Discovery Bank today, showing a deduction of 
R 435.79, plus interest charged on the amount. The deduction is placed on my account on 18 Des 2021.
I cancelled it right away, this morning, but was told it cannot be reversed as I asked for the service years ago. This deduction is for the new year. I am asking Discovery, I do not have the service any more, what should I pay for a service I cannot use in 2022. I looks to me they are getting fees for no return ? Sounds illegal ? If you deduct these fees yearly, is it my problem you do not deduct it monthly, so we as clients can cancel? 
By the way Discovery, if you react on this, please do not send me a private message, I could not read the previous one, send it to me by email or just post on Hello Peter so every one can see.
Thank you",1
Useless. Over 10 days waiting for them to release a hold from uber. Sent them communication and spoke to a team leader.,1
"On Friday the 7th Jan 2022, every month I am been harassed by this SMS s and I called on ********** spoke to Phakiso, Paballo, Daphney, Devlin and Sabelo on the account that does not belong to me, they all could not help me: Harrassing SMS Reminder keeps on popping: Payment on your DISCOVERY CONSUMER PLATINUM account of R R1,505.00 was due 2021-12-16.

"Not very happy with the service I get from a so called world class bank, I canceled my Wi-Fi subscription and by fault they still deducted an amount of R699 from my account, called the bank asked them to reverse the payment on the 31st said that i have a cancelation number as well as reference they said the payment shows pending and I must resolve the issue with the provider if they cant I must call back. Phoned the provider and they said they cant , phoned Discovery again now they say I need to dispute the matter and it can take up to 90 days and then still it might not be resolved. I am sorry but this is unacceptable!!!",1
I'm so Happy to be with a bank of the future.Im really impressed with their team and whenever I need assistance they're always able to help.Their staff are well trained and fully understand their product,5

Will be closing my account soon",1
"I have called discovery bank since 28 December 2021 with regards to updating my details so that the otp can be sent to my cell number and not to an email account which has been deleted for the past 3 years.

I cannot login into my discovery app as I have to link my device and I cannot link the device as I am not getting the otp. I was able to login then one day I received a message stating that I have to link the device - which I cannot.

I have called now numerous times, done various verifications, called by the fraud and otp department - I have been told that this will be sorted out but it has not.

I am very upset, I have not only waisted my minutes calling discovery but I have lost my vitality discount as it was reset on 1 January 2022). I now have to pay more than what I would have paid as a result of discovery bank's incompetence and inability resolve something as simple as to update my details.

I am tired of calling, I am tired of wasting my time and my money on discovery bank who simply refuses to help me.",1
"I am shocked by the customer service I have received through Discovery. Since November, my wife has been blocked out of her Discovery app due to Discovery merging their data. Since the data merger, they have been sending an OTP to confirm her identity to an old email address that belonged to her father which now no longer exists. 

She has been a member of my account since 2015?!

We have contacted Discovery numerous times with promises that they would help us within ""24-48 hours"" but at every point, it ends in no contact because their fraud department fails to connect with us?

As a customer of Health, Vitality, Life & Insure I am appalled by the incompetence of a department which should be the most efficient in the entire company. 
It is worrisome that a company as big as Discovery has merged old data and that a department as significant as fraud could be so inept. 
A greater concern for me is that my wife is due to give birth in 2 weeks and we still can't access her account? 
What the hell Discovery?",1
"I’m really disappointed in discovery bank. I attempted to get a credit card suite with them but got declined because it says my credit profile shows missed payments. Firstly the credit report they are using is outdated and secondly I was under debt review which means my accounts were paid on time but the debtors weren’t updating my profile correctly which made it seem like I missed payments. This was rectified in December but Discovery Bank uses a report dated to November. When I contacted them, I got told that because I was under debt review I can only apply after being 12 months out of debt review. This I feel is discrimination as I did something positive to clear all my debt and I never expected that from Discovery. Truly disappointed in them.",1
Discovery does not provide feedback on my case ref **********.,1
"Tried to make payments to my ISP, 2 payments gone through, next payment blocked. spent over 30 minutes over the phone with a lady to help me and the end result she said i had to contact the merchant. contacted the merchant - no problem there. this is so frustrating!!!
and i have another query outstanding since november that still not resolved. this is not a bank, this is a joke!",1
"Seriously guys this is so frustrating. It is easier to get my ID at home affairs. I JUST WANT TO JOIN YOUR FRIEKEN BANK. It is pathetic that I have been a customer of your credit cards for YEARS but you cant link my profile...3 calls later and I must wait for your OTP department to call me back???

"Now this is service !

This morning at 5:00AM when I woke up I noticed my one debit order went off twice.
I called discovery bank at 5:30AM and had someone answer me at 5:30:38AM this morning ! 
Service is the best at this bank.
I logged the query and at 06:00AM the transaction was refunded.

Now please tell which other bank is open 24 hours and will make sure the debit order was refunded in such a quick manor ?

Wow Discovery Bank ! Well done ! 
Thank you for being the best bank I’ve ever gone with.
I have tried (Standard Bank, Capitec, TymeBank, FNB)
None of these banks can compare.

"My complaint goes 2 ways. Neither Discovery Credit Card nor Chubb travel insurance when I enquired about the product advised me of top up insurance. If I knew there was top up insurance available, I would have purchased it. Chubb and Discovery can kindly listen to any calls I made enquiring about the insurance I receive when making a booking with my Discovery Black card

Now that I need the insurance I'm told I'm not covered, that what I'm claiming for is only available in the top-up insurance.

I'm tired of insurance companies not being open and honest and transparent and declining to assist clients in these tough times.",1

"This Bank has created stress and Anxiety over my life ,i didnt even have Christmas because my account has been  blocked for 3 months , worse they called me and told me that they will take my money and send to someone i dont even know or have relationship after 3 months starvation while i have money.They never respond to my email when they 1st blocked my account never even  call me ,i had to waste my airtime call them finding out what is happening submiting all my things ,they take weeks to respond .This bank is Nonsense bank doesn't even stand on the side of their clients taking instructions from other banks where i dont even bank .",1
"I never requested an account with discovery bank.
My account was migrated to them from FNB without my consent.
I am now trying to close my account as I am getting charged monthly for something I never wanted.
I contacted their helpline and was sent a mail telling me i needed to go online and click on ""close account'- When I do this, it tells me i cannot close my account from the web. Do these imbeciles even know what they are doing? I phoned back and was told by the agent that he cannot help me.
I cant even warn the public not to use discovery bank as it seems they are able to register one for products, and charge, for something that was never requested.
I leave for Portugal today to get away from this underhanded corrupt behaviour that defines South Africa.",1
"Looking through these reviews is rather scary for anyone involved or working for Discovery Bank, at this rate Discovery Bank won't be around for much longer. Before I start, Derek's complaint about Discovery Bank having no email address for issues is very valid, no physical bank, no whatsapp platform, no live bot, only a 'not so good' call centre to phone at the customers expense? I complained about this on a previous occasion and and note with regret that nothing is being done about it. On with interest rates. Discovery Bank reduced my base savings account interest rate from 3.2% to 2.75% in June 2021. At that time there were no SARB repo rate changes.  .50% change is significant for a retiree. One of the suggestions offered was that if I wanted a fixed interest rate I should go for a fixed term investment. Further I notice that with the recent repo rate increasing from 3.5% to 3.75% on 18 November I see a notification that they increased their lending rates by 25 basis points the next day but no change to interest rates offered on their (or should I say my) savings accounts. So unfortunately another resounding thumbs down for Discovery Bank.",1
"It is with great sadness that I write this review on this Christmas Eve, but after seeing Discovery Bank plummeting in ratings, I unfortunately must also have my say before deleting the app, closing my accounts and kindly sending my lawyer to tell them to remove my personal information with immediate effect. I have applied for a credit facility in 19-voertsek (I think it was 2019/20) but it has been a while back. The details that I've applied with is not even relevant anymore as I don't work for the same company or anything. They never provided feedback on the credit application, however, the ""Credit review in progress"" notification has been sitting at the top of my app for a good few years running. I have phoned possibly 15, 20, 25 times? Every time I ask to have the application closed and the notification removed, but I get routed to their fraud department, who then has a different story every single time. You do realise your calls are all recorded and I am now going to insist on you making all mine available to me, right? Then senior counsel is going to listen to your agents blatantly lying to me, deceiving me, making me look like a fool, when you're trying to hide your ridiculous suspicion that I somehow committed fraud (f*** knows how why where and when, but anyway) then we will collate the lies, draw up the High Court application and hopefully get someone from Discovery Bank in the benches for being dishonest, making false claims, defamation, and so forth. I'm not the legal expert but I have consulted legal counsel and they have advised that I most definitely have a solid damages claim against Discovery Bank, as they specialize in the law of delict. After giving them an account of the previous 2 years worth if ill treatment by Discovery Bank, the lies by omission, the harassment and unfair treatment via email, and even telling me ""well someone has to go to prison"" when they investigated fraud on my partner's account and insinuated I was the guilty party because they are incapable of drawing obvious conclusions. (I mean honestly, ***? how do you say that to a client!?) - So this is what it has come to, I just wanted to make the public aware of how quickly Discovery as a group of companies and their bank following suit now, will criminalize an individual and make them suffer the psychological torture for years to come. I definitely think Bank Zero is but the next best option or something less trite than Discovery's disgusting treatment of their clients. I wouldn't advise anyone to do so, neither would I do it myself, but if I could see your pretty new glass house from where you throw your stones in Sandton CBD crumble, fall and go up in flames, I will be the most satisfied ex-customer you have ever witnessed. Discovery does not deserve the success they have achieved, because their clients are worthless to them, its all about the client's ability to fork out and pay up that makes them sneer. You people disgust me.",1
"Upon expressing my dissatisfaction with their service and requested account closure, I was called by a ""manager"" as courtesy call who told me straight out it's her last day of work before going on leave therefore we need to have this call quick. I asked her why she called,  she said she's just checking if I want to close my account, I told her yes. She didn't ask why neither had an interest regarding my experience, with a nonchalant attitude said ""Ok"" and dropped the call.
Having being a client of Discovery for almost 2 decades and being their Discovery bank client during FNB platform days, it was the most disappointing experience ever with Discovery. One would think there will be some customer care and service. 
Discovery Bank just isn't worth it! They are expensive for nothing!


They won't even close my account after settlement amount paid! I've never seen such an incompetent and inconvenient bank! Such bad experience I've had with Discovery. I want my account closed and they can't even do that.",1
"I have been a discovery client for 5+ years and my credit card limit has been the same rediculous R1500 since i started. 

Since then i have taken up other credit cards and personal loans and discovery throughout that process declined a limit increase, other institutions gave it instantly.

During the last 6x months i have settled R200k in short term debt and closed the R40k limit credit card through standard bank after settling it. I did all this in order to ""qualify"" for a limit increase on my Discovery card.

And i am shocked that the increase in limit was declined once again. My installments on all the other debt paid off i am saving monthly now is in the region of R8000. 

I have never skipped any debt repayments and my ITC profile is in the top 1% in the country. 

Discovery states it is declined for affordability reasons, but a R30k credit card balance installment will be in the range of R2500...(I only want the limit increase to qualify for the Vitality device benefits) I am not even looking to spend the damn limit. 

I am R8000 better off per month, than I was months ago and at that time still managed to ""afford"" all the other installments. 

I would like to know if the analysts at discovery had any maths and what kind,  because you need a lesson in how to use a calculator. 

If someone in senior management does not contact me with a resolution, then I will cancel and move everything I have with Discovery: Medical aid R9500 per month; Insurance R4400 per month; Bank and credit card (Cute R1500 limit)....

Below reference number is the call centre reference when i phoned them earlier today: **********",1
"International funds transferred into my transactional account, bank in Indonesia has send all prove of which I have distributed this to two consultants at discovery with no reply.

Asked Discovery banks useless social media agent on Twitter to ask a consultant to call me as this was discovery’s error where my transactions are not going through. It’s been a good couple days and I have no response. If you ****ers don’t call me back by today close my account with your ****ty bank. People are getting paid to do **** all at Discovery!,1
"I'm beyond words Disappointed !! Been banking with Discovery for a few years, I received 2x Fraud cases opened on my account due to my business email being unaccessible for a few days where I could not communicate on time with my clients which I stated. Immediately I responded and attended the complaints once complaints were filled, both clients received their goods immediately and still my account is locked after I provided written emails from clients and their Banks departments stating they both are happy. I phone Discovery Fraud Department a few times to speak to the person who is dealing with my cases and still after 3 weeks, they told me the agent who is dealing with my cases will phone me and yet no one phoned me to assist me with this matter? No one phone call? Both clients who filed the cases from FNB Bank and ABSA Bank both confirmed via email & phone that both cases were closed at their Departments and clients are happy - Still Discovery keeps my account locked with no communication from them. FNB and Absa bank were both supportive and providing friendly / excellent service to me everytime I spoke to them and yet Discovery provides no service nor support at all. NO SERVICE ! NO SUPPORT ! NO RESPONSE ! Is this how Discovery treat their clients? Looks like FNB and ABSA bank treat people who don't even bank with them with neutral respect and providing 5 star service. People, be aware before you bank with Discovery, this experience will give you an idea on how Discovery treat their clients.",2
"People reading this, DO NOT open an account with Discovery bank EVER! You will receive extremely POOR service!! I'm regretting opening an account with Discovery Bank as they advertise and promise such good service but you will be very disappointed, because you will receive terrible service. Their communication is non-existing. They always say they will escalate something and someone will call you back, that never happens. You send them emails, they just ignore it. To avoid yourself a lot of pain and anger and wasting your time with this company rather go to their competitor Tyme bank. Trust me you will bet better off!",1
"Really unsatisfied with the service i got while applying for a credit card.
I applied and submitted the documents as required, was asked for an additional document to explain hourly rate differences, this letter was submitted on the 14th of december. i received a notification to say application declined, so i called to inquire about why it was declined. 

i was told the letters i submitted was not received, however i called yesterday afternoon specifically to confirm that the letter was received and when i can expect an outcome. i was told the letter was received and can expect outcome in 48-72 hours. 

now im told the document was never received so the application was declined, and i need to apply again for a credit card. i dont want to apply again because it affects my credit profile. i was also told i need to wait 3 months before applying again. 

I dont owe anything on my current credit card which i want to close as soon as ive been approved at discovery, my credit profile is very good and i can more than afford to get a credit card with discovery.",1
"I phoned for assistance, I waited less than a minute to be helped and the agent was friendly",5
"DISCOVERY AGENTS REFUSES TO TRANSFER ME TO AN EXCUTIVE AFTER TRYING TO COMUNICATE SEVERAL TIMES REGARDING A REFUND THAT WAS SUPOSE TO HAVE HAPPEND BUT STILL HAS NOT BEING DONE, THEY ARE WITH HOLDING MY MONEY FROM ME.",1
I am struggling to get hold of ANYONE at Discovery Bank since August to change my debt order details and they wont accept my new details but keep debiting my old account and funds obviously get returned and now they they have handed me over to a debt collecting company. IT IS BEYOND FRUSTRATING!!,1
"After decades of being with discovery on other products, this is the worst service and product they've ever launched! Had an unauthorized transaction on my discovery bank account: firstly the bank app doesn't have a facility to reverse unauthorized transactions like other banks do, secondly when I did call customer care and fraud line, I was attended with their lazy unhelpful attitude, I had to dig information out of them to even get proper info on how to get resolved. I  could tell they had no interest to solve my query, wasted my time on the phone with a tone and eventually told me to lodge a dispute with a ""merchandiser"" that defrauded my account, after explaining that I do not know who they are and requesting a reversal. 
So unhelpful,  so incompetent and such a frustrating experience to deal with Discovery Bank!!",1
"Discovery bank is amongst the worst service provider to deal with. Having received an email requesting me to update employments details and mentioning it can be done via the tablet, lap top, etc bit when you log on nothing happens. Then you call in and they mention use the lap top. So then I try and log in and after clicking online banking it’s a blank white screen and this was attempted few times. I have been on the phone for over 27 minutes to no avail and then been told to calm back tomorrow. What a joke as I am a businessman and wasted over 45 min trying to comply with their requirements which should have been in place from day one. Unfortunately nothing was done and wasted time trying to get this **** resolved.

I am a private client with FNB and believe me I don’t have any hassles with my banking app or getting assistance. Furthermore have a much more superior  credit limit with them then with Discovery and have pleasant experiences.

If they can’t sort this out then please close this stupid account as it’s if no benefit to me but only paying bank charges for something not used !!",1
"I have had a dreadful experience with the treasury department of Discovery Bank to day 14th December 2021
Firstly trying to get through them is a mission, i had left messages for them to contact me but had no joy, then i finally phone them again and eventually got hold of them. I tried explaining my problem and he was not willing to hear me out nor was he willing to give me the email address where i should lodge my complain, he just cut my call off, that's poor service. Also people working from home should be told to keep the noise level in the background to a minimum or at least have a room dedicated to work from, in the interim until this is over as background noise makes it very difficult to hear when dealing with important issues... totally dissatisfied",1
"To the agent who assisted me on reference **********, thank you very much for your friendliness, and kindess and assistance. Thanks for sorting it out so efficiently. Apologies I dropped the called before you could finish speaking. It was an accident. Thanks",5
"Worst service ever! 
As a 30+ years client of Discovery Health, I  received a Credit Card with Discovery, connected to, and administered by FNB. As soon as they started their own bank, I've requested that they cancel the card and close the account they have open for me. After months of requests and phone calls it seemed that they would close the account near the end of last year, This never happened and I continuously receive emails and SMS messages that I need to pay bank fees for the facility when I received an email from Adrian Gore (September 4, 2020) apologising for the poor service and assuring me the account wil be closed by end of October 2020.  The associated card has also long since expired and  never replaced - making the use of the credit card facility also not possible. Yet I still receive sms's and emails almost everyday regarding banking fees due etc. They recently started sending me bank statements and even started deducting money from my FNB account via a debit order created without my permission. Phoned again last week, was assured the account will be closed, received email that funds and fees were refunded and this morning, money deducted from my account by Discovery Bank. Looking at the other reviews, bad customer service and struggling with closing accounts is standard operational procedure at Discovery Bank.",1
"We had a horrible experience on the 9th of December 2021, where a company has taken out monies from my husband Discovery Credit Card account in dollars.  This company had made several attempts for funds,  my husband received declined transaction sms, however Discovery Bank had paid these amounts although my husband did not have the credit available.  Discovery Bank had paid monies out of the credit card account without my husband authorising these transactions, the amazing thing was he only had a credit limit of R20 000, however the account is now sitting at over R45 000.  How can any bank pay out funds you DO NOT HAVE AVAILABLE. 
Discovery Bank's fraud department has not updated us not a single time to date, they make promises but do not keep to it.  When it was reported the manager promised my husband he will call us will feedback the next morning,  we constantly followed up every day but fail to get any answers.  The the managers are never available to assist and provide information, the fraud department consultants are clueless and cannot even advise what is going on.  They cannot answer our question as to why they have paid out these monies when we did not even have the credit limit.  We cannot get a hold of anyone that can help us.
There is no direct number to complain to Discovery Bank.
Our biggest regret is opening an account with Discovery Bank - we did not expect to find ourselves in a situation like this and furthermore the bank is not efficiently assisting by providing feedback.
We called yesterday again the 13th of December 2021 for feedback spoke to a Sibelo who promised the manager will call us the moment she put the phone down from the call she was on - the managers name we were given was Bongi,  she never returned our call and Sibelo did not want us to hold on for her because he knew she was never going to call back.
Very sad to note that Discovery Bank treats their customers in this manner,  I was forced to share our experience on Hello Peter today as we do not know what more can be done.  It is now 6 days - no feedback but we got the instalment to pay for these amounts that Discovery Bank had paid out.",1
"After nearly 2 years I have finally thrown in the towel, Discovery Bank managed to completely change my perception of the Discovery brand and not in a good way. The only service I received recently that came close to matching Discovery Bank must have been Discovery Insure and  I have terminated their services as well.",1
"At this point, I no longer even know where to start. Working with Discovery Bank has been horrible. Everything is difficult. Everything is complex. Nothing works. The ""Bot"" Chat you get is useless. No one person can help you when you call. I've lost count of how many times I've phoned Discovery Bank in the last weeks. The amount of time I've had to spend on the phone. Yes, you do get ""rewards"" at Discovery, but at this point, it's not worth all the work, time, and effort trying to get anything out of Discovery. When I opened my account and it was awful, I gave them the benefit of the doubt. But now trying to move my wife over from Nedbank to Discovery, it's been worse. We've been going in circles over and over. No resolution in sight. You call over and over and over. You get transferred in circles. Calls get dropped. You have to start all over. No one ever calls you back. It's worse than having to call Telkom! If it wasn't for my company forcing me to move my Medical Aid to Discovery, then I would've canceled EVERYTHING I have with Discovery now and just moved back to where I was where everything was working.",1
"I bought flight tickets with my Discovery Bank Credit card. I was too unwell to fly, as per medical examination. I contacted Discovery Bank for a travel Claim, they referred me to Chubb Insurance, they then referred me to a third party insurance company. It’s being over a month I haven’t received any feedback from this third party Insurance company. Discovery Banks says there is nothing they can do? Why do they offer travel insurance???",1
"I recently joined the bank I battled to download after I have deleted the app from one device I called spoke to about 3 give or take ""consultant they couldn't assist me. Best last call made Minna Maila she it took almost half an hours because she wanted to make sure we get every right and sorted she has so much patience and you could tell by  the tone of her voice and can feel her smile over the phone. She also helped me out to active my card. I appreciate you lady. Keep it up",5
"Sign-up was not smooth and effortless. It took days to open my account. I phoned in THREE times asking them to please move my debit orders, and 3 times I got different information. At this stage, I was so annoyed and wanted to close my account. I phoned in 4 times and chose the option for them to phone me back because the phone just keeps on bringing (just a side note, this was a really convenient option for them to add because it saves airtime and time, just a shame they don't phone back). Phoned in the 5th time and got through to a consultant that seemed to know what he was doing. Long story short, my account is still not closed. Discovery banks consultants are very friendly, I will give them that. But moving my back account to them was a terrible mistake and an even worse experience!",1
"I have not received my correct allocation of Discovery Miles since September 2021. It seems to be a circus act between Vitality and Bank with each one blaming the other. I was even requested to provide till slips for my Healthy Living purchases for the months in question which is quite unreasonable during a digital age. It turns out that this wasn't even enough to resolve my query. 

I have been getting the run around and false promises from consultant Kgwadu and manager Diane. The latest false promise is that I would be allocated my miles in the middle of January 2022 when this was for purchases made from August 2021 onwards. 

I have 8 product policies with Discovery and the attitude of these individuals are totally disrespectful to a customer and not in line with the companies values. I am really disappointed as my premiums are always paid on time but am treated poorly when rewards are due to me and I have to jump through more hoops and endure more stress due to this situation that is dragging on for months.",1
"What a cheek Discovery! I have emailed their customer service email, only to get a response ' we dont reply to emails; you must call us'! At OUR EXPENSE, THE CUSTOMER MUST CALL DISCOVERY?!!!

WELL I THINK I WILL CANCEL MY DISCOVERY CREDIT CARD, AND TAKE OUT ANOTHER WITH A BANK THAT ANSWERS THEIR CUSTOMERS VIA EMAIL!!

DISCOVERY, PLEASE CANCEL MY ACCOUNT!

ONE MORE REASON, YOU HAVE BEEN CHARGING ME FOR A SECONDARY CARD FOR YEARS, THAT I DO NOT HAVE!

DEREK KRUMMECK",1
Absolute nightmare!!! Called on 28 October asking they merge my profile from my passport to my ID number. Sent my doc and got my reference number but no response in 2-3 days. Every now and then a banker calls me to respond to my query of joining the bank and I respond that I’m already a client and just need the profile merged. Aaarrghh if it’s not a new sale they can’t help you. It’s now 9 Dec and I’ve been following up pretty much every week for a month and still nothing. Absolute nonsense how it can take 6 weeks to update a profile. And once again the consultant has gone to escalate and investigate and will call back.. heard that about a hundred times this year from the overall Discovery company. Companies truly shouldn’t scale up if they don’t have operational capacity for it.,1
"It is impossible to renew your credit card at Discovery Bank.
It is so complicated that expect to be on the phone for about 2 hours at least !
You have to phone about 3 times!",1
"I had a Discovery credit card but have not used it for years - just kept it for in case I needed it for an emergency.  In the past, when my card expired, Discovery would inform me and arrange for a card delivery at my work address. I retired at the end of March 2017 but retained my mobile number, and never received a notification again regarding expiry of my card and delivery request for a replacement.  When I needed it again, it was refused and I discovered that it expired.  In the meantime, I still paid my monthly fees of up to R100 per month) to sustain my card service, not realising that it has expired.  I then called Discovery Bank (after the change from Discovery to Discovery Bank) with this information and requested that the issue had to be escalated - i.e. that Discovery Bank charged me the monthly fee to sustain the card service while I have not received an updated card.  This continued across many calls to the contact centre to request escalation to management to resolve the issue to pay back the monthly fees while I did not have a valid credit card from Discovery Bank, or close my credit card account.  After many months of trying to communicate this, I now demand both - i.e. cancel my account AND pay back the fees since my last card expired.
My calls to the Discovery Bank to the contact centre in this regard, resulted in a number of negative experiences (Discovery Bank is welcome to trace my calls - I am a retired global consultant in the contact centre industry).  These varied from a promise to escalate and call me back (without this happening) to just putting down the phone on me.  While I cannot afford to continue paying for a service that I do not receive, this is my last resort before reporting Discovery Bank to the relevant ombudsman.",1
"Thank you Discovery, the matter has been resolved",5
"I have been trying to close my bank accounts with Discovery Bank for 3 weeks, with over 10 calls from my side, two conversations with ""managers"" and I get nothing but promises.... Still nothing! Call centre can't help, have to escalate the query but nothing happens.",1
"This has probably been the best bank I have ever encountered. I have phoned so many time and the service is absolutely excellent. They are always friendly and so patient. I have recommend this bank to so money friends, and they also have so many positive things to say. Discovery bank please keep uo the good work. Your services is absolutely brilliant.",5
"My issue has still not been resolved !!!!!!!!!!!

I am still receiving emails and text messages and phone calls prompting me to pay for an account that was confirmed to be zero balance and an email received to say that this account has been closed!?

I can assure you if this is not resolved TODAY, I WILL report you to the Credit Ombud!

This is exactly the SLACK service you DO NOT WANT from a Bank.  You cannot even call yourself a bank.  You are a joke to society.

Remove my details from your system it offends me to get ANY type of communication from you",1
I have been with Discovery for a long time and over the years I have learned when to clear my credit card without attracting interest. Discovery has been charging me interests even though I have cleared my credit card within the 55 days stipulated to avoid attracting interests. I am not a happy client!,1
"Loving the experience on the app, easy to use and open bank account. Secure and safe",5
"I wouldn’t recommend them. When they just opened I was put on “a waiting list” as all my insurance etc is there. I never received any correspondence. I then tried to apply again- and never received feedback. The Discovery Miles looked good so I applied again. I did everything through the app which is extremely hard to navigate and finally got all documents up. They continued to send me SMSes informing me to submit documents, which I have done. Again today someone called saying they haven’t received the documents. 

It is a tedious exercise.",1
It has been 1 year and 2 months since my bank account has been frozen with discovery bank for alleged fraud. My identity was stolen last year and I was arrested for purchases not made by me. I had to plead guilty to the charges October 2020 to date I have not been able too get my accounts opened. I have sent emails I am told I have too send them the case file and advise that I plead guilty etc etc etc. Take note they keep taking bank charges off. I have not been able too use any of the funds in my bank account for anything they refuse to assist. If this is not sorted I will be seeing my attorney for retribution in the form of a civil case against them take note of the case law against banks. Note I do not have the necessary documentation to get prove I plead guilty that is up to the state not myself. This is terrible service from a bank that prides itself on customer service to be told by a bank they refuse to assist speaks volumes and henceforth I have advised my friends family and by extension colleagues not to use Discovery and any of their services they provide and trust me I know a lot of people.,1
"I migrated my Discovery Card from FNB in September 2021 and I have just noticed I am being charged R15 a month for Vitality.  I am an 80-year-old pensioner and Vitality is of no use to me, so I called the call centre to cancel the charge.  I am told this is ""part of the monthly fee structure"" and cannot be cancelled! WOW! What an attitude!
The call centre agent was very polite, however, but had to follow banking rules.",1
"I received money from my FNB account on the 5th of Novembe 2021, FNB then blocked my aFNB accounts, was then told there’s an investigation.After a month FNB then told my the case has been resolved, they will unblock my account and they did so.After a month I then made some deposits into my Discovery account and they decided to block my accounts saying that FNB instructed them to do so while FNB told me case has been resolved and all my FNB accounts are not blocked",1
"I lodge a case of fraud on my account in July,till this there’s no feedback from the bank and I continue paying bank fees every month. What frustrated me was I call their fraud division on Wednesday and spoke to a consultant who was not interested in helping but kept on defending the bank. The bank doesn’t not take fraud serious and it’s scary how they handling my case",1
All good until I had a fraudulent transaction on my account and from there just no joy trying to sort this out after I phoned them 2 minutes after the transaction took place to inform them that there was a fraudulent transaction....,1
Discovery you have disappointed me.I have been using discovery bank for 10 months now until today I will no longer use it.I went to Capitec Bank for a loan that I have been planning for a while and they said they cannot offer me the loan because discovery bank does not accept capitec debit orders.,1
"Absolute joke..... I wanted to use my Discovery miles then I was told to open a discovery bank account which against my better judgement did.  I repeatedly asked the advisor if they are 100% sure that by opening this specific account I could use my miles, well guess what YOU CANT!!  I have tried the pathetic what's app communication with no luck - who wants to speak to a robot - there are so many people looking for jobs that could probably do a better job than getting the same answer which has nothing to do with your query.  I earned the miles I want to spend them, WHY DO DISCOVERY MAKE IT SO HARD.  I tried to ask for info to cancel 9 products I have with Discovery but still no answer - I would rather move my business to a place that is actually willing to help a person instead of blatantly ignoring you",1
"I opened a transaction account earlier this year. In November I've upgraded to the full banking suite. now my transaction account doesn't work I'm battling to make payments and Discovery Bank call Centre and WhatsApp chat function is completely inefficient, there is no option for them to call you back",1
"I am totally disappointed in the the bank
At first you could not wait to speajk to us and now that you have us a client now we have to wait forever for you to answere your phones
So far i have been waiting 25 min>",1
"What a bunch of liars. Marketing to join their bank to get exclusive invites to a pre sale for Justin bieber. No emails. Calling since 6:40am and every call there's a different story. From emails we're sent to emails we're not sent as there's a system issue.
Seeing that u can't get this right. Once tickets are bought, hopefully they are. I will be long gone.
Discovery, always a time wasting lying institution.",1
"I had taken out the Apple Watch with discovery vitality last year , I am currently on an 87 week goal streak which has been broken due to covid restrictions. Discovery failed to provide me with proper information and this is on a recorded call. They further advised me that I am in a collection status which is mind boggling because according to them I do not have an active discovery credit card , but I do. I was then told to call discovery bank to link my vitality to the card , I called discovery bank and they said they do not do this and that vitality should do it . It’s an actual nightmare dealing with such a disorganised franchise whose system integration is so poor . My issue has not been resolved and the escalation process within the business is pathetic , they have taken zero accountability but have rather put the accountability on myself which is typical of business that does not put their clients first.",1
"My husband opened an account with Discovery he send me a friend referral code so that I can open an account as well and I send my mother in law with the promise we will get 5000 Discovery Miles. Signed up and everything.
Now when we called in it says the account we chose is not liable to get the 5000 Discovery Miles. But that wasn't communicated. 
Discovery are liars and is doing false advertising.",1
"The application process is a nightmare!!
I have been back and forth with getting documents uploaded to the mobile app, then told to upload more documents, which the application and website does not allow me to do.
The call centre agents then tell me the documents are fine and that there shouldn't be any need for further documents, to only then be sent another mail to upload the documents I have already done.
Then get told to upload a new document that was required, which again, the website or the app does not allow. Emailed the document to the credit department as requested, to only be declined a day later because I didn't send the document. Now get told that I have to start the entire process all over again??
If it is this impossible to open an account, I can only imagine what it would be like once there is a legitimate problem with my account later on.",1
"Why is there no SUPPORT email address that can be used to contact Discovery? The consultants are not allowed to call you back plus also show aggravation - have had a few hang ups - therefore any query/concern about your finances, investments, health, life, vitality is just escalated by the cost of the call... and these seem to take forever with the continuous questions that need to be answered EVERY SINGLE time you make contact with them.  I am aware that security is of utmost importance BUT at the cost of customer service you NEED to come up with a PLAN!  
This frustration is aimed at ALL Discovery departments, Bank, Health, Investments, life, vitality .......",1
"Please be aware of False Advertising with Discovery Bank.

Discovery Bank has Advertised a Platinum Full Banking Suite ""Get financially fit and get rewarded with Dynamic Discounts"" with the following features:
Up to 60% off local flights
Up to 100% back on gym memberships
Up to 50% back on HealthyFood items
Up to 50% back on HealthyCare items
Up to 50% back on HealthyGear items
Up to 15% back on fuel
Up to 15% back on travel

So I have called and spoken to a consultant, of which the consultant clearly agreed is part of their Features for the Platinum Full Banking Suite, however when I began to activate, nothing seemed to work.

I then called Discovery Bank again and the Consultant informed me that all is fine on their Side and all I need to do further is call Vitality Health to activate their Product(Which she mentioned ""used to be R75, but has now Increased).

I Gave Vitality Health a call and they mentioned unfortunately I do not Qualify for their Product, As I got to have either a Medical Scheme or a Life insurance!

Please be aware of all Discovery Advertising, After a chat with Discovery Bank yet again, they are claiming that The Platinum Full Banking Suite is advertised BUT unfortunately they are other products that need to be activated first in Order to have these Features listed above unlocked, and that they will only provided for 25% of the 100% of the Gym Membership BUT ONLY WHEN I HAVE VITALITY HEALTH ACTIVATED!! Now Clearly! There is no SMALL PRINT!

I definitely will not start a banking Future with a company that has so many riddles and completely NO TRANPARENCY in their offers, trying to lead me into taking multiple Products before Granting what has been promised from their very first product Taken.",1

"Yet another review where I am forced to award a start that is not due!!!

Discovery Bank .... I paid my credit card in full and sent a request for this account to be closed on the 15th of October 2021.  I sent a follow up email on the 18th of October?! ... No reply ... not even a reply to say that the email address I used is not valid or a ""no reply email"" so you got my request, but apparently you do not deal with emails.

I received a statement with an amount of 76.41 due ... for what?!!! A card facility I requested to be closed ... with interest on the card facility amount?!

Reverse these charges and CLOSE THIS ACCOUNT!!!

I phoned on the 15th of November to query this statement and was told someone will get back to me .... still nothing.

Yesterday I receive an email telling me how I can close my account online. I cannot close it because of the 76.41 due.  I will not pay for something I do not want and requested to make an end to!

You are definitely NOT recommended as a banking institution.",1
I needed to make a payment for a car I was purchasing. My dailly limit was not sufficent. I phoned the bank at 10h00 and they sai that the dailly limit would be increased as requested. During the day I phoned the bank 4 times to follow-up. Every time I was told that this has been escelated to a manager. On the 4th follow-up call when told that they would escelate again to a manager I asked to be put through to a manager that the previous calls had been escelated to. After waiting for 15 minutes the bank consultant said that she could not get hold of the manager  and that the manager would call me. We had committed to sending proof of payment to the vendor before 16h30. I then made a 50% payment and will have to pay the balance the next day.,1

I am asking for a small amount so I can get the benifits basically give me a small credit let me utilise the amount build up trust and get the rewards! discovery doesnt even care to do this",1
This bank clearly doesn’t know what it’s doing because the customer service here is below par. I’ve been dealing with the same query for almost a month now. A query where I’m clearly in the right and they can’t even resolve it or at least communicate with me! Annoyed 😒,1
"When you refer someone to Discovery bank you receive 5000 discovery miles. That is what it says on their website… I convinced two members to join Discovery bank. Gave them my referral code. Expected to receive a total of 10000 discovery miles. Got denied because of a technicality. 

Discovery cheated me out of 10000 discovery miles. I wanted to use it for electricity to alleviate some of the financial strain of lockdown. 

Their response was that even though I went through all the effort to convince the members to join I will not receive the miles, the technicality came in with the first member because we had to use the call center to take us through the process to open an account because firstly I am not a discovery expert and because someone help us the referral does not count. That is a pathetic reason I still referred the member! 

The second member accidentally signed up for the wrong account and had to change to another account and because they had to phone in to go through the process, because of that the referral does not count. Again I still referred the member to your bank! 

Now tell me how do you expect people to convince others and give referrals because it is after all an insensitive to make use of your clients to get more clients. Because of this you will not see me talk or promote Discovery bank ever again! In fact I will make a point of it to discourage people to join. I am disgusted in Discovery Bank, they undermine their own clients. WATCH OUT!",1
Very poor service I have been waiting a whole month for anyone to get back to me every time I phone the agents just say someone will update me on my application and yet no one does,1
"Discovery Bank has illegally without my request or consent put up my Credit Card limit.  I want my limit returned to what it was originally.  It doesn't matter how many unwanted incentives Discovery tries to add to my Account or Card to try and bribe me to use it, I won't.  I will never use the Card or Account again, I am patiently paying it off, and once this is done I will close it and throw a party cause this useless institution is out of my life.  If you want to learn how to manage a Credit Card properly, then maybe as Woolworths as they know what they're doing.",1
"Thumbs up for innovation but yet you dropped the ball. I was convinced to move with the integration and rewards system and the full banking suite. Still after a year I'm not getting what I signed up for. Seems Discovery forgot about TCF?? I'm so disappointed and lost complete faith in them yet you still get bombarded with new products. Discovery bank, 1 final chance to correct the wrong, if not, then it 

seems the old traditional banking will be the way to go",1
"I have been struggling for 4 months now to reverse a debit order from my Discovery Bank account and still no luck. Please South Africa, never open an account with Discovery or believe the adverts they have every night on TV",1
"Their Banking App and their web-link failed dismally to provide a certified copy of a bank statement. I contacted them and was informed 24 hours, within the 24 hours I contacted them few hours before the time frame lapsed and was provided with another case number and was informed it was escalated. To my disappointment, they failed to email and/or provide the stamped bank statement. How does a customer now rely on this service provider. I am starting to have my doubts and I am irate at this point.",1
"I have tried cancelling my Discovery Bank credit card multiple times. I've called in, followed all instructions, yet it is still not closed. I am getting charged fees although I have not used the card in over 5 years! This is criminal.

Why is it such a mission to close the account? I am not paying a cent more.",1
"Not only is it the most painful experience to try and access your money from a savings account, the customer service consultants seemingly don’t know what they’re doing. I am closing my account and it’s only been less than a month. Awful CX. Awful bank.",1
"Excellent, effortless straight forward way of joining the bank",5
"After a not so great experience in opening up an account, for whatever reason. The bank redeemed itself, I mean the service afterwards have been great and everything was on point, received my card in time as they promised, I can't wait to move my salary to Discovery. Thanks a lot team.",5
"Yho what a bad service yet again, my husbands got paid and he never even touched his money, we were called to advise that theres some fraud transactions that happened and that he would get the money back within 7 days, yey i tell you since the 25th till today were told the money has been processed and some tell us that it will be processed, too many different stories... mind you we have been patient waiting for the money until we were told that it will be processed when days before we were told withing 24hours it will be in your fnb account, till today we have not received anything.. we have bills to pay, now we will be charged for late payment and affect his credit record... Discovery bank, we are comng for you, and also note action is been taken. dont be surprised... Mr HC Moruti made a mistake staying with you the first ttime you gave him issues.",1
"Was told that if I open account via refferal link I would get 5000 miles after I make my first transaction, I did but didn't get the miles 🤔 so if you already lied once I should I just close my account again.? You are untrustworthy from day 1",1
"I would recommend anyone to join Discovery bank.
Terrible service!",1
"Discovery Bank contacts me daily to apply for discovery bank account and credit card. I have been with my Bankers for more than 30 years, but decided to apply at Discovery to earn the credits and to qualify for discounts they advertise.
I do not even need credit from them, and found out that I was declined on their system. With much frutrastion I try to get them to remove all my personal data and any further adverti*****ts to me from their system. After several calls on my own account and time, combined with a lot of frustration, nobody could assist me to confirm that all my personal data are removed from their system. I will never be able to reccomend anybody to discovery, and good luck for the people who decide to do so in future.",1
"Mt credit card with Discovery Bank was paid in full and cancelled in October 2020. They are still debiting my current account with bank charges over a year later. I have called them several times to correct their actions and still, NO ACTION has been taken.

This is pathetic service delivery!",1
"I have phoned 5 months ago to open an account with them. I gave permission for the credit check, ever since they do one every month which decrease my points on my credit score??????? I want this fixed. last one done oct 2021??? for what??

I still dont have an account as I wanted to move from FNB to them, but there was issues with the app and profile, so I phoned again 3 times today and then the phone are put down in my ear.",1
This has been the most terribke banking experience in my history. The promises made and advertising is completely ridiculous and not a single promised reward. Thousands of fine print catches and unnecessary charges. Also extremely impossible to use.,1
"Discovery App - Re-Sync Device
My Discover App stopped working 3 weeks ago requesting me to Re-Sync my Device.

I attempted to Re-Sync my device and the message I received was that an OTP was sent to my E-Mail Address.

That E-Mail Address was unfortunately no longer active.

I contacted the relevant Discovery Call Centre for assistance 4 times in last 3 weeks.
This was to update my old email address to the new current email address.
I also supplied my current cell number.
Each time I spoke to someone I was told the old email address has been updated on their side but I would need to be contacted by their Fraud Department to enable me to be Verified.
I was told each of the 4 times that I would receive a call for this purpose which has not been done.

All I want is to receive my OTP on my New Email Address to enable me to Re-Sync my device to enable me to Login to my Discover App.

I am becoming very frustrated and I am unable to access and use any of the features on the app.

I have spoken to a few friends who were also requested to Re-Sync their App to their devices which they were able to do as they all received their OTP as their cell numbers or e-mail addresses were still current and unchanged.

The unfortunate position with myself is that I CHANGED MY E-MAIL ADDRESS and for some unknow reason the call center are unable the update it.

Please help !!!!!!!!!!!!

"I moved all my accounts and investments to Discovery bank with over a million rand investment on a fixed deposit. All I needed to do was get a credit card so that I could benefit from having a suite, but NO according to them I don't qualify as my income is not enough.

"I phoned your call centre on Monday 8 November 2020 to enquire about interest charges on my credit card. The consultant told me that he wouldn't be able to assist as another department would have to look into it. He said that he would phone me within 24 hours to give me feedback. It's Wednesday...and I'm still waiting for my phone call. So how many calls do I have to make?

I just need to understand why I was charged interest on the 7th October. I made a R11500 purchase on 1st September. Made several small purchases as well during the month, but made several payments during the month to the total of R7912.10. During the next month I continued making payments with a large amount of R6500 on 13 October. 

On 31 October I made a R1605.84 purchase and charged interest of R21.21 on the 7th November. Please explain your calculation.",1

"I recently obtained a full suite from Discovery and even qualified for the 100% gym discount through Vitality. Thus far, I have not enjoyed the benefit and only receive 75% off. A debit order switch was requested and has still not been completed. One would assume that because Discovery and Virgin Active are in a partnership, this should not have been an issue, however I cannot the gym as a result and Virgin has advised that I contact Discovery to make payment which does not make sense if Discovery have confirmed that I qualify for the 100% discount. I'm regretting my decision to move to Discovery as there is no alignment between them and their partners. I had a similar case at Dischem and Woolworths where I was advised to apply for new Vitality cards with their respective stores so they've sold me the idea of these benefits with their partners, however, I'm not enjoying them as a result of their lack of onboarding. Avoid if possible.",1

I tried making a manual payment and it failed and kicked to back to the accounts page but noticed there's money missing. In fact the payment went through not just once but twice...even though it said payment failed.

I immediately called and the logged a ticket or something. Later that day the company I sent the payment to called and said they have not recieved any payment yet, so my question is where is my money? 

Thank you",1
"I just want to thank Discovery for not sorting out my issue i have with their OTP system that sends the OTP to an old number of mine.

I have contacted Discovery Bang on the 28th of October to report the issue. i then contacted them on the 2nd of November where I was told by the consultant that it will be 24 to 48 hrs  and that is business days and I should not worry i will be contacted by the OTP department to sort out the issue.

That obviously did not happen. 

Today the 5th of November I decided to call Discovery Bank again and the issue was then apparently escalated with the promise that i will be contacted by the escalation department within two hours of the call been logged.

I made this call at 10:00 this morning and it is now 13:48 and guess what? No Call from Discovery or any of their world famous OTP or escalation department.

Please can someone help???? It is a simple issue to resolve.

HOPE TO GET A CALL SOON.",1
"On 14 June 2019 I closed my Discovery Card account. I fulfilled their prescribed procedures which included:
Filling in their ‘Account Closure Form’
Paying the outstanding ammount reflecting at the time on online banking
I emailed above form and proof of payment through to them, also on 14 June 2019.

On 21 June 2019 I phoned a customer service representative, Vivian to confirm closure of my account. He confirmed closure and provided call reference number **********

But soon there after it seemed a third party re-opened my account without my permission and commenced deducting fees from my account. I contacted Discovery Card several times to investigate why they will allow a third party to re-open my account without my permission, as this constitute as fraud. The call reference numbers include:
23 August ’19 ref no: ********** I spoke to a Mapume
15 Oktober ’19 ref no: ********** I spoke to  Chase
and ref no ********** I spoke to Prudent

It seemed an impossible task to get any helpful information on the subject as to why I were adviced my account is closed on the 21 June 2019 call, just that another third party can re-open it  without my permission afterwards. This constitute as fraud.  As I already did all steps to close this account, I certainly were not willing to pay any more fees.

Discovery Card seemed incapable to communicate any helpful information to me no matter how many times I contacted them by phone. I will never have an account with a company where I can not readily have a walk in service in my area. For it seemed near impossible to close the account, and Discovery Card continued billing me monthly account fees. This, together with the the third party, now constitute as just over thousand rand, which they handed over to laywers to black list me! Of all things. And they are the ones who did not perform their duties.

I then opened a case with OBBSA. They reverted the case to Discovery representative Nicole Sarlie, who could not provide solutions. This was then reverted back to OBBSA who also procrastinate providing a rulling. Nicole Sarlie said they will write off the Discovery Card fees, and only expect payment for the third party which they allowed illigally to deduct fees. Now, it is no favour to deduct fees for a service I closed, did not use nor requested. Furthermore I waisted a lot of time to deal with the incompetence of Discovery Card’s customer service providers. Time is of more value than money, and Discovery Card is evidentually disrespectful of this fact. Furthermore Nicole Sarlie still handed over the full so called outstanding ammount which included their bankfees (which they seemingly are willing to deduct) for blacklisting during the period of investigation, prior OBBSA’s ruling. This is unreasonbale as we do not know what is outstanding until OBSSA provides a ruling, so how can they black-list anything?

Nicole Sarlie said she will retrieve the call where my account were confirmed closed (reference number **********, 21 June ’19 with Vivian). She said they will let me know of a date when I can come in and listen to this call. I welcomed this. But next moment all they could do is send a transcription of the call, not the actual call. When I insisted I want to rather listen to the actual call, they then mentioned they lost the ‘security’ call. Now, how can one send a transcription of a call you have not located? It seems they cannot locate any of above calls! Nicole Sarlie then suddenly needed all kinds of irrelevant information to evade responsibility. This information included details such as the number I phoned from 2 years ago. I provided, the date, customer support representative names, ánd reference numbers of various calls.  This is more than sufficient information as the reference number is the key to locating a call on the system. 

The whole thing is now a bit of a big business bullying situation. We all hate it when it happens to us, but how often do we do it in the capacity of our own work? Still truth remains, treating someone in a way you do not want to be treated, is not a good idea. It tends to take a full circle and becomes a culture of ‘no care customer care’. And when we get replaced by AI robots we protest: ‘how unfair’. Ultimately we are suppose to treat others as we want to be treated. With good service delivery the economy do better and consequently the banks do better. So quickly we forget it is all about relationships instead of regulations. In a sense I understand, yet not agree, why we think a robot can take the role of a human. Ultimately every human that forgot their true purpose in respecting and caring about creation and their Creator, is not truly adding value to life and consequently rather depleting the system. To truly care is good values, and a person that care should be valued. Hardly is someone of value merely due to some status whether it is intellegence, position, power, money or education. That is why it remains truly sad, as I do not want to speak to a robot, it is like speaking to a brick wall, but what is worse is a human that acts like a robot, simply not listening nor caring and merely ticking the box of regulation and procedure and dishing this to clients. This, when clients ironically are the people that contribute to our salaries. Biting the hand that feeds us is not conductive. And though clients can be unreasonable too, too often do we have to deal with one sided business which is evident in security calls that are only there to protect the interest of organsiations, but not the interest of clients. Rather than taking an interest in clients, we add more interest to whatever account they might have. Okay, all jokes aside, this is serious business.

Except for the missing ‘security calls’, Nicole mentioned the account had bank fees outstanding on the time of closure. Hence the account’s balance was not at R0 at the time of closure and could therefore, according to Discovery’s procedures, not be closed.
Now first of all, why did Vivian confirm my account is closed when I enquired with call: ********** on 21 June 2019. Secondly, could none of the other customer representatives advice me this when I enquired several times thereafter for the reason why my account was ‘re-opened’, or at leat I were placed under the impression by Discovery via representative Vivian, my account were closed and opened by a third party.
Furthermore, these bank fees did not reflect on the internet banking site on the day that I paid the outstanding ammount. Possibly a glitch in the system that causes a delay from the time of billing to the time of refelecting it live on the online account?

But most importantly, banks is one of the only groups that black mail customers into continued business simply due to an outstanding account. In almost all other business the outstanding account is seperate from the running account / business contract. If you close your gym, phone or what ever account, you close the contract and there is no more running monthly fees. However the outstanding amount at the time remains outstanding until paid. This is then the amount that can be handed over for black-listing if due payment is not received in a given period. The banks should find ways to seperate these different accounts as they are two different issues all together. It actually goes agains customer protection rights that allows the cancellation of service with imidiate effect when this is requested by clients, and a client may not be forced into continued business. That I filled in forms and paid the outstanding amount, continually called and requested the cancelation of my account, should be sufficient to close the account. What ever was outstanding at that time, which according to you were one month’s bank fees, should then be send as a seperate outstanding account. I will pay this, no problem.

If the banks do not change this unreasonable procedure where they force people into business until they pay, simply adding more bills to the outstanding account, they increase poverty even further as if poor people  cannot afford to close an account it simply keeps on amounting. 

On 28/06/21 I listed a case with OBSSA which have on the most part been ignored by the designated member, Alison. She has provided no correspondence, reactions of any sort, not to speak of providing a ruling. It has been many months and she ignores emails send to her. They give one no choice but to believe they play a passive role in protecting the public against exploitation by banks. Does this organisation have a purpose?",1
"As a customer of 20 years, and having bought into the entire Discovery ecosystem, this is without a shadow of a doubt the worst experience I have EVER had with any bank in my life. If I could give  a ZERO, I would.

1) 2 months, 9 calls, 3 cases and just over an hour on calls and I still cannot close my account

2) No new card shipped to me since the change between FNB to Discovery, no matter how many calls etc. Apparently I have to call them each time, but still nothing, the online portal is shocking.

3) If you bought into the Discovery Ecosystem, your mobile is King ... But just make sure you do not ever have to change your number ... 10 working days, 3 calls, 2 cases and I cannot access anything Discovery on Mobile as their OTP Department is shocking

4) Every time a call is escalated, it is basically meant that I was escalated in a black hole.

5) It takes 20 mins to open an account, BUT I was told today it can take 2 months to close the account

"I have been with discovery for about 15 years, I owned a credit card may years ago and then transition to fnb and ebucks. I got tempted with the rewards and applied for a credit card earlier this year which promised 55 days interest free, after 2 months of in excess of R400 in interest charges and calls to the call centre which proved to be a waste of time I cancelled the card. A few months later I was tempted to try again as I live in area which is close to woolies pick n pay and dischem, 3 months later and many submissions os supporting docs their system glitch has jammed my application at the final hurdle many promises of managers that will call me and many many emails to their credit address I still have zero response from them",1
"One star too many
Why?
Discovery in their wisdom created a bank account for my credit card.
The Discovery team picked up a fraudulent transaction while I am offs****
I asked to monitor the situation and explained that the card needs to pay 3 monthly debits.
They stop the whole card and my 3 monthly debits was cancelled.
I moved those debits away to another card.
I have asked to close the card and its links as there is no need for it.
5 months later and I still get monthly statements.
I AM NOT INTERESTED IN DISCOVERY !!  They stuffed it up
Discovery keeps on phoning, I do not want a phone conversation as there is no audio recording to go back to.

On the 23rd of October 2021 my phone and wallet were stolen  and that was the beginning of the longest nightmare. i was unable to process any transactions with Discovery Bank as i did not have a phone. i phoned and asked them to prepare a transfer on my behalf which can only be done on a case by case basis. With any other bank you are able to issue an instruction. So much for the Bank being cutting edge. i was then issued a card that i cannot activate without the app. i cannot purchase a phone as the card is not active. how does a bank and company that strives to be market leader in service fail to deal with such an eventually in a country like South Africa,1
"Always so helpful. And always fast and know what they are talking about.

"I am a client of Discovery Bank and very happy.  My mother then asked me to get a credit card for her because she saw all the benefits I receive.  Today she got a call and said her application was declined.  They asked about her income and she told them that she gets social security.  She doesn't get a proof of that, but it shows in her bank account.  She also told them that she gets a pension income from my late father's fund from Eskom.  She haven't received that slips yet since his passing.  She also gets annuity income from investments from annuities with Discovery.  My mother has numerous investments with Discovery of over R1 million.  

So I cannot see how you can decline a Gold card application for her.  You can clearly see on her bank statements that she get an income.  The decline letter didn't even show the reasons for the decline.  With service like this make you wonder if it is still worth her while to keep the investments with Discovery.",1

I moved to you from my previous bank because your product seemed innovative and refreshing, but I am starting to reconsider my decision after two experiences with your support service. Everything works great, until your staff actually has to fix something.

A monthly payment was double deducted from my account this morning. Your fault, not the merchant.

I called in about it. Was told I'll have to dispute the 2nd payment and wait a week or more for a refund. I wasn't happy to just accept that. I was told to hang on for 2-3 minutes while it is ""escalated"".

Well just over 20 minutes of listening to your really irritating music I was finally told that someone would get back to me.

This never happened at my previous bank. Such mistakes were reversed within a minute or two and it was clear that my interests were put first instead of forcing me into some costly beaurocratic process because someone else made a mistake.

This is the 2nd time in 3 months that something like this has happened. Not going to take much more of this, I am clearly not the priority in how your systems work.",2

"Yesterday,  Friday October 29, I got scammed out of a R26000 phone. A Samsung galaxy s21 ultra. I got the phone on contract and I needed to sell it as I needed the money for my little girls operation. This guy supposedly transferred the money from his discovery bank account but it ended up being a false transaction. He used the intellectual property of discovery Bank namely their logo, letter head.  As the owner of that intellectual property discovery should be held liable. Intellectual property of a major company like that should not be accessible to the general public but yet they got their hands on it. Stricter security measures should've been in place to stop things like that from happening. How can discovery be so negligent as to allow that to happen. Their security on their intellectual property should be much better. If it happened to me it happened to others and it will happen to more people. I still have the letter they sent me with confirmation of the transfer and also the sms. My name is Sandro Oranzie email is ***********",1
"Discovery Bank heavily advertises their simple sign up experience, but in truth, it's horrible. The hassle with documentation and getting them to accept someone, especially a non-African person, is ridiculous.

The criteria for their Platinum account is a minimum income of R350 000 which is way less than what I'm earning, yet my application for a Gold account has been refused twice even though my income exceeds the requirements for Platinum. The reason for refusal is that I allegedly do not meet the minimum income. I have provided bank statements, confirmation letters and even had my ""employer"" contact them directly.

Communication is always vague and these people have never heard of ""passive income"" or ""allowances"", despite being a company that advocates for investments and sells products promoting such. If you do not have a traditional employer, expect a horrible time doing business with them. If you are of a foreign nationality, expect even more trouble.

I am unemployed, but I earn more than R350 000 - this is something that Discovery simply can somehow not understand.

They have already been in the news for discriminating against non-Africans, particularly white folks, and it seems that Asians are their next target.",1
"I contacted Discovery Bank on the 18th October to have a transaction reversed for a product that I ordered online but never received, I tried several times to contact the supplier with no luck.

Going back to Standard Bank, there I had a Prestige Banker who would have reversed the payment within minutes!",1

Not only were they unhelpful they went and blamed my Network for their App. They then told me that it will take 21 days to resolve the issue and an agent from Disputes will contact me asap...

I have called and emailed the Discovery Bank team daily and everyday is another excuse!!!
Where is my money?! 
Absolutely pathetic service!!!",3
"Its still a struggle to get any responses from the fraud team at Discovery bank, even when you try following up using your ref # on email, they will still ignore it as is. 
I have been now left with no access to my account for 5 days now with no explanation except the fact that my card is blocked. I don't know if i will receive another card, i dont know when? i have no money to buy necessities or travel to work or take the kids to school but this means nothing to my all so trusted bank right?. I have sent emails begging for at least a response at the most so i keep having hope that this will be fixed but no, the bank feels it ok to just leave me hanging and say they are still investigating. Being without cash for 5 days??? come on guys don't do this to me really. What do i have to do now to get help what please tell me and i will do it, i need my money please HELP me",2
When will discovery bank update their details with the department of labour? They are not listed as one of the major banks and as a result this has caused my UIF claim to be delayed by 4 months. This is unacceptable.,1

Getting no response and not having things properly resolved now now seems to be the norm with Discovery Bank.

BUT STEALING MONEY? / ...could that really be happening??",1
"WORST BANK EVER
Every time I receive a payment it goes missing, my salary won't be released today on the 22 the reason they can't release is that my salary normally gets paid on the 23rd. Immediate Payments I have to wait for 24 hours for the funds to reflect in my account every time I receive a immediate payment.
I've just had headaches, and I'm in tears every time I do banking. I'm so disappointed and sad.",1
"If I could give them a zero rating I would. A transaction made to my account was raised as a red flag. As the transaction was made by an FNB account, I had notified the person who made the transaction who then proceeded to remedy the situation with FNB. My card was locked without my notification and I was stuck at the petrol station with a locked card. I have phoned Discovery Bank numerous times speaking to their fraud department who time and time again refused to take some sort of initiative and contact FNB to remedy the situation. On two occasions I was left in tears at the absolute disregard and almost accusing nature of the consultant on the other end of the line. It is now month end and my salary will be paid into my account with me having no access to it. Discovery has truly disappointed me in this regard.",1
"Amazing service,

After 2-3 weeks after applying for credit at another bank (Not to be mentioned) I was assisted within 20min, including downloading the app and getting the credit application approved.

The previous bank ask me for HARD copies of my bank statements and 45min-1.5hr queue to get my FICA done after banking with them since 2014

I want to thank Meme Mpholo for her professional service and patience with me!",5
"September and October, Discovery Bank has charged me interest on my credit card that was paid up in full at the end of each month. Each time Discovery Bank has apologized, stating it is a system error and the interest was charged in error. If I hadn't have noticed, would I have got the money back? Still waiting for the refund!!!",1
"The Fraud team is currently assisting me with my case, i will give a final review pending the outcome of the matter. Thank you",4
"The banker on duty (1900 last night!) was Mmina who answered our banking questions calmly, most politely and efficiently assisted me and my wife to open the most cost-effective combination of transaction accounts on the Discovery app. 

Big banks should take a page from this service delivery book....",5
"Hi my Discovery bank has been put on a block and have been trying to have the issue rectified for the past week. Each time I'm put through to the fraud department either they don't know why my account is locked or they disconnect my call promising a callback that never happens as I'm not even asked which number I'm available on. My phone is damaged and my card is lost so I stopped my card then downloaded the app on a new device. There hasn't been any new or irregular activities on the account. The lack professionalism, efficiency and client support is appalling.  I emailed the complaints department on the 15/10/21 and 17/10/21, all I'm getting are automated response. Called in today and I'm devastated because now the fraud department can't assist me cause they say they can only verify me through my number. I have access to my emails and their app. Don't they have a manual verification? Was advised that the complaints is also available by email. I'm confused as now my matter seems to be ignored and no one is willing to assist. Was planning on moving my salary to Discovery bank😭, just imagine this happening to my salary and debit orders not getting anything. Thought an online bank was evolution, I don't recommend them as there are no easily accessible branches to assist. Have a spend alot of money on phone calls",1
"I am under debt review as a result of covid and not being able to get a job for 2 years. If I could halt the process I would as I am now in a good position. Be that as it may. I pay for Vitality money monthly, my credit card is paid by the debt counsellors and I top it up to meet the monthly payment requirements. Now because its been flagged as debt review my account is apparently not in good standing, yet it is UP TO DATE. So now I am not eligible for any of the rewards that I PAY FOR on a monthly basis but they are quite happy to take my money. I requested a call back from management, no one called, I get a ****le on social media responding to my query. Do not deal with Discovery Bank, you will get passed from pillar to post, they won't assist you and you don't have a direct line of communication.",1
"My apologies, but I can’t help laughing at you guys…. My credit card application got decline due to outstanding documents on the 16th after I called and confirmed on the 15th that all documents was received. You need to check your staff working from home… I think they are lazy and sending bogus decline letters to potential clients……",1
"Can’t withdraw or swipe money
Terrible",1
"Apologies for directing this query here as i can not locate the discovery bank email address to contact. Kindly furnish me with the banking side email address as there just was an amount that was taken a momen ago from my account. It is in USD of which comes as a shock to me. 

The challenge when i call the helplines is that after entering my ID number it prompts me to enter the OTT pin sent to my initial phone of which is lost as we speak. I can not see the OTT pin nor SMS due to me not having that phone. May i kindly ask for assistance as i am not finding joy at the moment. 

Your assistance is highly appreciated.",3
"6 weeks ago I sent hellopeter my complaint about discovery bank sending my wife and I spams adverts daily to our gmail addresses offering credit cards and banking. There has been no response in all this time and we get daily spams. We have sent dozens of complaints to discovery.bank.co.za and the spams keep coming.
Do they not realise that we would not deal with a spam bank?",1
"Discovery is general is shocking in Customer support. You cannot get hold of them and they also dont assist in a manner which they should as a corporat institute.

I have a problem with my credit card and still today their IT department cannot fix and or update my details its shocking.

Let see if they would now contact me since this post on Hellopeter.

Mark",1
"After seeing the Discovery advert on TV regarding how easy they made banking, i decided to do an application with them. When contacting them I was advised that I should download their banking app as everything needs to be done on there. I did my application on 27 August only to be advised that it is under review. After waiting a few days, I logged in again requesting an update. Still no answer and I thought to myself WOW this is so contradicting as portrayed on their TV ad how easy it is to bank with them. Low and behold I receive a call from them today asking if I still need assistance. This is just under 2 months later. Wow that is world class service. Ironically, I also logged a call regarding their medical aid and still waiting on a return call.

I'm thinking of just cancelling myself and my wife's products we have with them as they seem to have forgotten about their customers.",1
"Tis bank is a rip off. for months i been asking that they CLOSE my account. Today i get an email asking me to pay R241.41 after me overpaying them a few months ago for over R600 in error. i been literally begging them to close my account that i never used for years with them. I do not even have a credit card with them but they gave me a new credit card number????
i installed my app and now they asking that I close the account on the app. I do not even have a password ??????
People be warned that you will be ripped off even if you do not have any transactions. Stay away",1
"L
I have been trying to get my discovery credit card closed since 3 September 2021.i paid the full amount and sent an email to close this account. No one responded. Instead there have been numerous charges accumulating on the account, which I also paid. I called in yesterday to ask for this account to be closed. I was given a case number **********. Today I received a missed call from their number. I called back several times and was not authenticatied. I received another call from them which I answered but no one was at the other end of the line. I finally got through and spoke to Junya. She was of no assistance whatsoever. She told me that someone will call me. I am not always available on the cell phone, so people cannot call whenever they feel like it. I am quite perturbed by the fact that she told me that I cannot contact anyone from Discovery Bank via email. Why is that? In what Era are we living in? She said that if no one can get hold of me then I must wait for someone to contact me via email. This is ridiculous! In the meantime they keep charging me fees when I requested closure more than 6 weeks ago! I advised them of the times that I am available today . Noone contacted me.I advised them further thant if I do not receive an email, I will post this on every media platform and contact their CEO 's office directly. I am sick and tired of being given the run around by them. I texted them on FB and they promised me that someone will call me. But nothing materialized. So I will contact Hylton tomorrow.",5
"I SPECIFICALLY SAID WHAT HAPPENED - but it now seems that it is 'DEFINITELY' not Discovery Bank's system at fault HA HA!  Their answer

Dear Pierre
Thank you for contacting Discovery Bank.
We are not seeing the attempt of the Web Africa Network transaction.
Once a transaction is stepped up on the merchant website it automatically triggers the 3D secure there is no manual intervention.
May you  to please attempt the transaction and save all the screenshots then we can query this with the Acquirer if the problem is not with merchant.

Should you have any further queries, kindly contact us on **********.

Does anyone know how Vitality Money Rewards are calculated. As,I spent R 60 and got 0.5 points, and then i spent R1200 on a different occasion and got 2 Points only.

 I called Discovery Bank and the consultant could not assist so i emailed them last week, but they have no responded since. 

This is the only platform that we get a  response quickly.",1
"I asked to close my account last month. They tried to entice me with an upgrade on the card and said they would refund me the last year of banking fees, due to the incompetence that I was never able to upgrade the account. One consultant told me I should have been paying less per month and the next one said that it would cost me more??? I’m then told that I would receive a rebate on the years fees as the account has not been active. That a follow up call would be made on the Monday…. I have yet to receive that call???? This was over two weeks ago. I now see my credit card is still active, and I now OWE R 67.41 ???? I paid the outstanding balance last month, IN FULL and I told the consultant on the phone that I was not paying another cent. She confirmed that I had settled the outstanding balance. She would also follow up on the rebate… 
I was also told that if upgrade the more rly fee is more, but was told by another consultant if I had upgraded (which I tried to do so many times and gave up) that my monthly fees would be less?? I also cannot access the discovery bank app because I don’t have the “full suite” of banking?? So really, what is the point? I also don’t have control with communication of said account settings, I don’t need two emails and two smss a month reminding of my balances ! 
I want to close this credit card and Discovery bank are making it very difficult! Fleecing more money out of me and ignoring my request!! They also refuse to transfer the lousy 292 miles over to my vitality and I also cannot find a way to spend said 292 miles before they disappear! 
I am SO SICK of rubbish service and being ripped off by this company, refusing to pay for chronic medication, moving the goal posts yearly to make it harder to achieve goals, offering maternity benefits to woman instead of benefits they need as they get older… blah blah and I could go on, unfortunately there is more wrong that is right now with this company!

Directed to Playstore. No update, but only open the app. Then go back to Discovery Bank app and if you have time ... loop until infinity. But let's say it like Yoda, ""Pay, I must.""",1
"It is impossible to deal with Discovery Bank. I was charged interest of R145.13 for paying my account short with R0.80, but was paid 5days before due date! After many attempts to sort this, an after hours manager, Justin Zwane phoned me at 18;00 on 28th Sept 2021 and advised that it was a system error and that he would personally ensure that I was credited for this interest. On 30th Sept 2021 @ 11:40 I luckily got hold of a certain manager, Musi Ndlovu who advised that the matter was sent to ""Finance"" to be credited which would take 3-5days, but to no avail. Today, 11th Oct 2021, I twicw tried to contact a manager or supervisor and ended up being put on hold for 5minutes and 12.5minutes respectively before ending the call. To date I have not been contacted. 
During 2016, I had a similar issue, which caused me to close my Discovery Credit Card Account.  This non existent service is leading the same way.
I have already settled my Apple Watch Benefit and removed debit orders from this account.",1

"I bought electricity tokens on the app, and unfortunately added one extra digit to the meter number. My R1000 is gone, no tokens, and no help from Discovery to sort it out. Prepaid 24 needs a proof of payment in order to trace the purchase, but Discovery Bank can and/or will not help me. Been trying for two weeks. Why does the app not warn you that the meter number you enter is invalid? Like the Absa app did??? Then I would not have been in this mess.",2

"Worst experience ever. Firstly no option to report the fraudulent transactions on the app or email notification. I had to call your call centre. I informed the gentleman that there was a payment reserved on a card that no longer exists. He then started interrogating me as to how I knew that the card no longer exists. He proceeded to confirm that the card was destroyed, yet a transaction was still allowed through? How is that possible? He kept on repeating “oh so you are saying you want me to open up a fraud case?” And that there were previous payments done with that card, why wasn’t it reported? Why would I report a payment on a card I had at the time? The card in question was destroyed 2-3weeks ago, and a transaction went off today! That’s why I called your fraud division! Which is of no use whatsoever! Just another call center agent clock watching!",1
Discovery bank miles program is shocking!! They don’t advise you that they cap your miles!! You are meant to get 1 mile for every R20 spent; but when you reach this “cap “; you need to spend R100 to get a mile!! It would be nice if they told you!!,1

"I recently applied for a discovery gold bank account. Unfortunately the benefits ate not transparently laid out as shown on the brochure. If you don't take the suite which includes the credit card, if you qualify, none of the other vendor benefits become available to you. This marketing strategy is definitely not transparent. I feel you are being sold a product which does not meet your needs. Keep in my mind they take a fee every month for this account that really doesn't give you much at all. To earn interest set amounts must be kept in an account. Please note this is on a transactional account into which a salary can be paid. Think about everyday living, so the only way to do this is by placing money into your vitality savings, so there is potential interest you can bank on. So no gym benefits, no dischem, groceries, uber petrol or any other. if you don't take a suite with a credit card on which you must spend a certain amount to earn points for your benefits. So please consider carefully beforehand you take out an account. As the marketing is wonderful the product, wellnot so much.",2

"It's the absolute worse bank I have ever come across. Extremely expensive, poor service, useless consultants and corrupt.  I have been trying to close my credit card with them since March and its still not closed. My credit card was paid off and Instructed them to close it. They are sending me from pillar to post, coming up with different excuses and yet continue to charge me  their ""ridiculously exorbitant bank"" fees. 

I opened the account in Dec last year, I used it once in Feb. In March they send me debt collection reminders. I called them and it appears much of what I owe is accumulative bank charge. This was a substantial amount in bank changes so I paid them off anyways and instructed that they close the account. I also informed them that their account fees were too much and I wasn't really using the account. 

In June they send me premium collection messages again, apparently these are bank charges accumulated after I paid. Out of frustration and not so useful consultants. I paid the settlement amount again, and told them to close off the account. Now in October I am receiving debt collection messages. 

What do I do.",1

Some teething problems of course (such as having to manually categorise my vehicle finance and tracker transactions for each month from Sept 2019 to date due to the match algorithm not picking them up, maybe try a reference match thats not 100%?).

I would not suggest that anybody ever uses them . I was planning to move all my things including medical aid to discovery but will not touch them after this .

Since then, Discovery Bank got established and the account was thus transferred to their systems. I receive a call out of the blue stating that we have funds outstanding on this account, fine, so I ask them to email me the details so that I can pay the entire outstanding amount and then close the account all together. I have no interest in having an account with Discovery Bank. After three phone calls and empty promises I still haven't received an email. I do get threatening sms's about being handed over etc but no help at all to close the account, paying into what account number and so forth. This is pathetic Discovery. Don't send me threats when your admin is up to rubbish. Sort this out please so we can part ways soonest.",1

"So I have decided to close my Discovery credit card as it is worthless.  I now find out that I could have been paying less fees if I had upgraded my ""account"" which, I know I tried to attempt several times but the email allegedly sent (a few times) just never arrived, I eventually just gave up.  Now in the several conversations about this upgrade, WHY WASNT IT MENTIONED to me?? This supposed upgrade could have saved me allot of money over the last couple of years.  
You sent out an email however, why wasnt this communicated to me on the several occasions I call Discovery Bank to assist me with adding the new information on my current FNB banking profile, SURELY YOU COULD HAVE MENTIONED THIS TO ME??  
I tried to access the app several times to do the ""upgrade"" you speak of however every single attempt came back as ""sorry you need to activate your discovery bank account to use the app"" and so it went on and on. I eventually just gave up. The paper work I requested to do the upgrade also just never arrived.  It just didn't, simple. One cannot keep on calling the same institution over and over.  
Whats more, when all the changes took place, YOU DISCOVERY DECIDED NOW ALL MY CASH BACK MUST GO TO THE CARD, This is never authorised and only found out months later.  WHO DID THIS?  My cash back has ALWAYS gone to my Fnb account, I had to call you (so many times) to request my cash back be changed BACK to my fnb account.  SO YOU ROBBED ME THERE TOO? I NEVER AUTHORISED THAT CHANGE.  Who did?? 
Now the lousy 292 miles I have fall away, because YOU discovery once again failed to do your jobs adequately.  I am told my 292 miles cannot even be transferred to Vitality active rewards??  SERIOUSLY?  And now I cannot even find a way to spend said silly 292 discovery rewards.  
You cannot blame me the client for ""failing to upgrade"" when the app kept on telling me I have to be discovery bank client??  
I am ****ED off once again, and I now know I am not the only one.  Too many problems and I RESENT YOU FOR WAISTING MY MONEY ON YOUR SILLY LITTLE CREDIT CARD.   Money I need MUCH MUCH MORE THAN YOU. 
I have now requested to close this credit card, once and for all. The outstanding balance has been paid as of 28 September 2021 and I will not pay you another cent.  
SHAME ON YOU DISCOVERY. SHAME ON YOU. Once again, you disappoint!",1

"Trying to receive a OTP from discovery bank is like sticking pins in your eyes.

I've been trying to spend my discovery miles. Now it requires a OTP. After countless emails and phone calls, I was told it was sorted. Guess what, it wasn't.  Told to turn off our secure WiFi and use mobile data. If that doesn't work we will need to use another mobile. How do I manage to get a OTP sent from my Bank in London, 6000 miles away, but never a OTP from Discovery. GET IT SORTED DISCOVERY

"The most confusing accounts and total lack of customer care.

I just opened a transaction account (not realizing its linked to my credit card ) - confusing information .  I moved my salary to be paid into this transaction account along with key debit orders.

So my salary shows as available (well into the +)- account has no overdraft facility . I get to the shops today  - transactions declined . Transfers  don't work   etc.
Without notice or communication they have loaded a credit block on my credit card  (which has been paid every month) which also disables  my transactions account. So I can't pay my credit card and can't access the money till I do???

A call to customer support - issue was escalated to management and I was promised a call back same day.

3 months down the line the card is still active and I am being charged for fees and interest. When I enquired with Discovery, they advised it was because they sent a follow up email for my cancellation that I never replied to. I phoned in and confirmed the cancellation!

My bank also closed my bank account at some point so I was not able to pay them as a beneficiary anymore as I was at least willing to try make some payments even though I was in so much trouble with money/unemployment etc and its only gotten worse.  I was attempted to be sued for the gazillionth time, not my fault, I was also evicted under hard lockdown and lost a substantial amount of my possessions (not worth much but everything to me but it was my home and my son's to visit.  NOBODY actually cares as long as they get the funds they are claiming EVEN if they state otherwise and that happened with STD too and none of it was my fault.  I tried since then via branches/store/email and every possible means a human could try to make some kind of contact and payment to no avail.  Now I am being harrased 24/7/365 and hounded for the money.  Worse, they say it is my fault that they have never bothered to respond and also that they are no longer IRL business so I cannot pay at FNB.  i can assure you I tried that too, many times.  I have explained and made a tentative sarrangement for when I do have funds.  However, they insist on calling 60x per day and claim its their right.  I then have to explain the whole story in detail over and over EVERY time.  They just say that's how it is, not THEIR problem.  I have said I wlll pay as soon as I can.  Surprise surpise I cannot reach them to get bank details....but apparently I am the one who ignores communication (which I do now as I have had more than I can take already so phone calls now go unanswered and will remain so until I receive a new account with actual information that i can ACTUALLY use to pay in part or in full.

I did have industrial machines that i want to sell, i recieve an call from an Black lady, Lorraine cell number **********, that they are intrested in the equipment.

She bring two black men with her on 13/09/2021 around 2 pm to see equipment. They decided to to took it. I said to them that i will not realease that not before the money is in my account.
The did not left the property and i gave them my bank details. They went to their car and did the payment, i open my FNB app after they said they make direct payment from Nedbank account (Olé Media) to my FNB account(account no above).

I realese the equipment to them, and they left. I did an few transactions from my Fnb to my OWN bank Accounts. The reason for that is that i dont have an FNB card to do transactions.

Yesterday 15/09/2021 i want to use one of my Thyme Bank cards. AT Incredibale Connection they told me that my card is restricted. I did went on my Tyme Banking app and see that both my bank accounts have hold on its.

I call the Discovery Call centre and the consultant say Fnb stop my account on request from Nedbank, because of an fraudelant payment from Nedbank -R150 000.00.

No bank contct me to ask what is happening or just make sure for blocking my accounts.
 In All THE BANKS TERMS AND CONDITIONS THE IS AN WARNING NOT TO SHARE ANY OF YOUR LOGIN DETAILS TO ANYBODY...
1. THIS COMPANY CANT SCREAM FRAUD BECAUSE HOW CAN ANYBODY GET YOUR LOGIN DETAILS THAT YOU WHERE SUPPOUSE TO KEEP JUST FOR YOURSELF?
2. WHILE THEY WAS BUSY LOADING, THE EQUIPMENT THE BANK CALL THEM TO CONFIRM THE TRANSACTION.
3. SO THEY HAVE THE COMPANY PHOHE ALSO TO MAKE THIS DEAL WITH ME TOTALLY LEGIT.

Now i sit with all my accounts blocked and my name bad at the banks, because this company did not do what THE BANK WARN THEM AGAINST IN THE TERMS AND CONDITIONS AND THEY SIGN TO IT ALSO.

I WILL ALSO LAY AN COMPLAINT AT THE BANK OMBUDSMAN BECAUSE I DID NOTHING WRONG EVERYTHING WAS AN LEGIT TRANSACTION FROM MY SIDE AND AFTER THE BANK CALL THEM ALSO TO CONFIRM THE TRANSACTION.

I WILL NOT LOOSE THE MONEY BECAUSE THE COMPANY DID NOT KEEP THEY BANK ACCOUNT SAFE .
MY QUESTION IS HOW MANY PEOPLE HAVE THIS LOGIN DETAILS IN THE COMPANY AND THE USE OF LOGINS AND CELLPHONE.

THEY MUST TAKE THE LOSS ON THEM SELF NOT FOR COMPLY WITH THE TERMS AND CONDITIONS.

FOR ME IS THAT I DONT KNOW THEY DID NOT DO THE TRANSACTION AND SCREAM NOW FRAUD.

"A month since my initial application, and almost 3 weeks since my 2nd application for a credit card. Discovery Bank has sent me from pillar to post regarding finalizing my credit card application, I've called them endless times during the course of the past weeks and they haven't helpful nor have they communicated with me in that regard not even an email, SMS or call. 


This has surpassed all my worst customer experiences, they agents are friendly and seem to be helpful but they have no clue how to go about my query instead they send me from one department to the other. 


I've reconsidered my onboarding and I'd advised anyone against joining discovery bank. I honestly should've seen the reviews on hellopeter first before deciding to join the so called ""Bank Healthier"" institution and now my credit score has taken another hit with their inquiry. 

Utterly Disappointing Discovery Bank.",1
"I have had the worst experience trying to upgrade to the full banking suite after being with Discovery for about 3 years. I understand that they might decline me, even though another Bank had no issue at all giving me a similar banking package, without hassles. What really gets frustrating is dealing with the Call Centre, Discovery does not follow up or call you back. You need to do all the work, sending them documents is tedious. The worst part is that I have closed my account, and Discovery is still doing a ITC check on my profile everyday! This is negatively affecting my score, is this on purpose? I approved to one check, there have been 10 made in the last 2 weeks or so. How will Discovery resolve this asap!?",1
"I closed my discovery account a few years ago 
the last 2 months i have received notifications that someone is trying to charge something to the account and at the same tim giving me a bad credit record

Remember i received R87000. And I transfer R101000. Please help me cz now I can't do anything because of that. If they suspect fraud they must take that R87000 back and carry on with my account",5
"My complaint is regarding a Discovery Miles dispute. I struggled to use my Discovery Miles as payment method on Takealot, which has happened a few times before. After numerous calls to Discovery Bank they assured me that all is fine on their side and I therefore retried. The transaction failed again, but this time the Discovery Miles was not returned. It basically got stuck in ""reserved"". I then logged a dispute with the Miles Dispute Team, which was a week ago. Until now (a week later) I still have not received my Miles back and Discovery has not contacted me to provide any feedback. 

I have also phoned a few times over the last week to get feedback. I have not been assisted with any of the calls. My dispute has been escalated twice, still no miles returned and still no feedback. It seems pointless to keep phoning about this and to keep logging disputes or to escalate. It seems that nothing is happening and I am just wasting my time trying to follow up.",1
"For 2 consecutive months Discovery have not awarded my rightful Healthy Food cashbacks. For the month of July spend the shortfall was 6088 Vitality Money miles (a cash value to me of R700).  After umpteen calls, hours of cell phone airtime and many ignored emails the problem has still not been properly addressed.  Furthermore my new month of cashbacks has just come in and this time there is a shortfall on both the Vitality Money and Vitality Health cashbacks. The problem is clearly not a once off. It is virtually impossible to reach a cashback specialist and the service from that team has been a mess.  I was contacted by a cashback specialist about 3 weeks ago but this contact has since vanished and does not return calls or respond to emails. I pay a premium monthly fee to be a Black Full Suite account holder and do so because of the associated Healthy Food cashbacks benefit. In addition I put in effort to maintain Diamond status on both Vitality Health and Money. In return I am contractually due my rightful cashbacks",1
"I had an account with Discovery Bank and paid them in full and paid an extra R600.
i got a statement in August that i owe around R48 I then send an email and sms askng that they CANCEL my account as i do not owe them any money.

so they just add to your account and your amount from over paid to owing is unacceptable. ITS A RIP OFF!!!!!!!!

"I've been a Discovery Bank customer now for around 6 months. After a rocky start signing up with a negative review here, the subsequent months have been smooth sailing. 

I changed over from FNB as Discovery Miles seemed a more attractive reward program than eBucks. My decision was cemented when my interest rate on a Flexi Deposit account, was higher with R1000, than a similar account at FNB with R40,000+, that I'd had open for years.

In summary, the bank has worked for me flawlessly since I've joined, and the rewards are top notch (with the caveat that I have Medical Aid and Insurance with Discovery as well, greatly boosting it).

Just wanted to post a bit of support for the team, as I've truly enjoyed my experience.

"Instead of fixing their mistake, Discovery Bank rather 'closed the case' (#**********) and communicate their unilateral decision by email - I kid no not! [Read: who is the client in any case - only one of 375000 odd?]
After giving instruction that a TFSA be 100% transferred to another institution, a Discovery Bank 'banker' forgot to include the interest up to the date of transfer and hence kept the account active (with the interest that should have been transferred) and suggested that the client take the knock for their mistake by having the interest transferred to a DB savings account (and in the process lose out when the amount is deducted from the lifetime contribution permitted to be invested in a TFSA; do these 'bankers' have any detail knowledge of the products the bank offers?)
Email sent by DB indicates that they failed to make contact; however, the phone in question did not reflect any missed calls - tough to be unscrupulous in an electronic age.
Good luck in growing a client base with such service levels.",1

i can always reach someone, even at 2am. 
they sound like graduates. i dont have to repeat myself and they are concise and helpful. 
you can open and close accounts, order bank cards, speak to them about vitality, medical aid, insurance, whatever.... they sort it out immediately. 

Incredible service. the only thing missing is bond and finance for home loans, but you will get there!

ive been with bidvest and nedbank as a kid, they were okay. you still had to go into the bank, but it was helpful and really qualified staff. 

absa has been my worst experience in terms of customer service in my life. 

standard bank is also incredible, but right now... in terms of practicality and convenicence and really making your life simpler in every possible way.... its discovery. ",5
"'The future of banking,' they say. Well, not in my book. Yes, the systems are quite impressive, but not that much better than what even low cost banks 'for the masses' currently offer. What drew us to Discovery Bank was an almost two decade long engagement with their Vitality program and the rewards it entails - if you manage it well.
When there is any problem with the 'system' (always created by a human) it 1) takes ages to get the problem logged through the client service consultant, who cannot help you, but merely acts as a filter to give through the problem to the 'back office' with whom you may not have any contact; until 2) the 'back office' comes up with a solution (usually indicative of the fact that they did not understand the problem in the first place), which is then 3) communicated to you (usually by email to avoid further inquiry) by the poor service consultant whom you spoke to ages ago. They 'say' turn around time is '3-5 working days', which often it is not! In any case, when I have a problem with the bank I still keep my 'main business' with, I go to the branch (yes, it's a hassle) BUT after a consultation of 15-25 minutes things are done, sorted - and I'm a happy client.
Hopefully the future holds much better than what Discovery Bank's current service levels suggest.",1
"I had fraudulent transactions in my account where someone tried to withdraw money from account 3 times declined and the 4th attempt was successful. No one called to check if this is really me why so many attempts. I reported the case and the consultant confirmed that my card was indeed clowned. He blocked it and confirmed that I will receive a new card. Indeed 3 days later I got my card delivered. An arrogant white investigator called me to say unfortunately Discovery will not reimburse the money bcz it show that a manual punch was done where these transactions took place. But the consultant confirmed that it shows that my card was clowned. He said with so much confidence THAT WAS INCORRECT INFORMATION. How sooo???? I asked Mr white investigator to even check my transaction behaviour, I neeeever use that account to withdraw cash, I use it for online purchases. Unfortunately I was told I will not get the money.

I honestly do not need this credit card I only took it bcz I wanted to boost my points. I’ve got Discovery insurance, Discovery health, to have Discovery bank was just a cosmetic thing really not that I needed their money. 
I am really worried that such a big bank cannot protect its own money and try to scam their clients.

I want discovery to reimburse this money. I want no stories",1
"The service that I have received from Discovery Vitality/Bank on this matter has been shocking.
It is hard to properly rate them since overall I am very happy, but the service on this matter has been terrible.

Discovery owes me a Gym Booster Benefit cashback that dates back to January 2021.
I had to wait until May 2021 for a partial payment of the outstanding amount.
I have had no explanation for the partial payment (as apposed to the full amount that is due).
It is now August and I am still waiting for the balance of payment from January.
And in addition the full benefit for August is outstanding.

I have sent 7 emails about this issue to Discovery since January with no joy.
And I have lost count of the number of phone calls that I have made.

I am hoping that Discovery is still willing to resolve the issue.

The last one just transferred me waited for 20mns over the phone and up until the agent dropped the call.I trusted the brand but the service I received isn't like Discovery as I trust the brand.",2
"After 8 phones calls to the  Call Centre, a secondary credit card can still not be used. Been a Discovery customer for many years and they cannot upgrade a credit card, nor fix the problem. Old card deactivated ! If a bank cannot do the simple things, how can they be trusted with hard earned money

AVOID People",1
"Discovery Bank Referral code campaign, it’s just a rubbish.

Poor service: I’m very disappointed!!!!

For two months with no response, 

I’ll not recommend it anymore!!",1
Discovery Bank does not adhere to the POPI/POPIA act and violates non-clients' email inboxes.,1
"SPAM. Every day, several times a day, I get SPAM from Discovery Bank offering me credit cards or loans, and I am NOT interested.. And complaints to them do not stop the deluge",1
"I joined them in 2018. I only started using the service seriously in 2021 and I must say I’m happy with this bank. Unfortunately they do restrict certain international purchases. I’m happy with the service, customer care and patience and they go out of their way to notify you when your request is successful I mean keep up the amazing service.",4
"Interest was charged on my credit card due to late payment in April2021. I queried this with Discovery in early/mid May2021. Up to now the responses have not been sufficient, and the query is still unresolved. When I asked for a meeting with someone in their product development team (ie, someone who understands the interest calculations), I had to first log a complaint. This was logged on 11 August. It is now almost two weeks since logging the complaint (and 3 months since the original query), and I've not yet had a proper response. I'm disputing the interest charged as, in my view, it does not match their Ts&Cs.",1
Had the  pleasure of speaking one of the consultants at discovery who assisted me with refunds for cancelled subscription GREAT JOB DISCOVERY,5
Guys can you help me. I have savings account but the only thing I have is account number. Don't i get card number? Something like a debit card because on the app there is nothing under virtual cards. Are there physical cards? ,3
"I am having the worst experience. I get 2-3 calls from different consultants about my migration to Discovery bank.
I have told all of them that my details on their system are incorrect and that I will not be able to migrate. I have sent the required documentation, but nothing is happening.
None of the consultants seem to have a clue and they don't show interest, to the point where they hang up on me. 
Will I trust my money to this organisation? Not a chance.",1
"I have been a DiscoveryCard (previously managed by FNB) holder for over 10 years and recently have been forced to migrate to Discovery Bank. The migration can only happen via their app, however the Discovery Bank system reflects my phone number as belonging to multiple profiles (which should not be possible). I have placed numerous calls to their consultants, and eventually managers who have made me try every idea they can think of to update my details, from updating my and my dependents' Discovery Health info to deleting and reloading apps etc, none of which have worked. Apparently they cannot override the incorrect information (which they populated) on their side, even on instruction from me, the account holder. I have been without a credit card for over a month, and am essentially paying fees for nothing. When trying to close the account (out of sheer frustration), the same phone number issue prevents me from proceeding as this too must be done online. So I no longer have a credit card, and I cannot close my account. So I am paying fees for nothing, and their consultants cannot help, nor can their IT people. Is this their way of keeping clients? Provide no service and then make it impossible to leave? ",1
I have only received exceptional customer service from Discovery Bank. I have not had a single issue to date. Keep it up Discovery Bank. ,5
"Firstly, they were supposed to deliver my credit card this morning before 12 noon. They even confirmed via sms. I went home at 10am and waited for delivery until 1pm!! They never came, or even phoned for courtesy?! They wasted 3 hrs of my time! Secondly Discovery card do not reply to emails?! There is NO excuse for this!! During Covid, a business should reply to emails!!! They expect customers to call, at our own cell phone expense!! I will be moving to another credit card for sure! Discovery customer service is pathetic!!",1
"I applied for a discovery bank account in July 2021 and the process was so easy, what was a #WIN for me is that the card was delivered to my door step! I was impressed with this and another #WIN was discovering that just by opening the account, I got free miles which I can use to purchase. Thank you Discovery

"For an up coming bank they make it impossible to get a credit card if you don't have a work contract. It's like they don't want customers. You could have over a million rand your account but because of there policies, they won't let you open an account with them.
This policy of having to have a work contract during these times need to change in order to grow your company. 
Proof of income, savings and payslips should be enough to open an account.",1
Is there any reason that you listed Takealot as a partner while there is no option to pay with miles on Discovery day.,1
"I have been harrassed non-stop, all day everyday for the passed 4 months.
For some reason someone has used my cellphone number for their account. I ahve told them repeatedly to remove the number as it is incorrect, spoken to managers about the situation and even done several complaints through their system. 

Nothing has changed. I still  get calls and messages. I am harrassed to no end, all because they will not remove my number when I am not the person they are looking for.

I do not recommend ANYONE to use Discovery Bank, if this is how they treat information, then your information is not safe. Clearly they bought my information, as companies usually do, and decided to use my contact cause they needed 1.

I have opened a case of harrassment.

You can't even block them, cause they use different numbers and different areas. First its Joburg, next its PTA, now I have the numbers from Port Elizabeth trying....",1
"I have tried to enquire on numerous occasions why I have to pay a Vitality Money fee on my credit card every month. I do not have vitality, I cannot get rewarded for these 5 behaviours as I do not have any of these products! '
'You get a Vitality Money status based on how well you're doing across five financial behaviours: having enough savings,
managing short-term debt, having the right types of insurance, being on track for retirement, and managing property investments'
All I am told is that it is a fee which is payable. Period!
Discovery Bank's card fees are ridiculously high

I lost my phone that had the app. I want to use my card urgently but I cannot since Discovery has taken the whole day to fix the OTP issue. I am not able to register or rather update a new number as we speak meaning that I have to wait till you guys can get back to me to use the card and hope that people who stole my phone do not use the money in my account since they are able to get access and I cannot. Shucks guys!!!!! I did not sign up for this honestly. ,1

"I am shocked and regret opening a savings account with discovery bank.
I have been wrongly advised about the saving product and have had no resolution in terms of correcting it for over a week now.
Below are all the reference numbers I made a note of 
******************************00878

I transferred money on the 31st  into my account to make sure i had money to cover my debit orders and true and not.  On the 1st when my debit order was meant to go off it was returned as unpaid. Discovery made magic and it disappeared just like that. I logged a complaint over a week ago and nothing... are you guys really that desperate to take you clients money  really. You guys are just as bad as the rest of them. ,1
"Staff are very helpful and friendly but they have a technical issue that renders it all pointless.
So I have phoned about 5 times now to try and change the number I use for my OTP, when you phone the number on the banking site, you are asked to provide your ID and then they will send you an OTP to verify it is you, and I get that - but if you are attempting to change you're OTP - and no longer have that number, you won't get the OTP. 

Thus I phoned another number I found on their website and spoke to a lovely Lady that easily helped me set it up for my medical aid, I then asked her if she could help me with my Credit Card OTP number change, she said yes and directed me to their ""Credit Card Department"" the phone rang a few times then just stopped. So I phoned a second time and the same thing, third fourth etc.

TLDR: You can't change your OTP with Discovery. I still have my old sim somewhere, I guess I will see if I can changed it with my old number... Like an hour of my life for nothing.",2
"Its been a month of multiple phone calls and emails and no help (first emails started on 20 June 21). Discovery motto is blame the customer. I can provide possibly more than 10 reference numbers that get closed before the issues are solved. 
Everything I ask comes back to me being at fault. 
1. Discovery bank doesn't work properly since the day I opened the bank. I have asked countless of times to fix the issues and Nothing. Same blaming mentally. My spending doesn't get recognised by the vitality rewards, and I was blamed for having my savings in the wrong account and that I must move the money and spend more and it will work. Its still not working. I was promised a call and I didn't get it. Every week, it says low savings but I have saved higher than their minimum. 
2. Healthy Food cashback February 2021 - Pick n Pay and nothing from there and I am blamed that I only activated this on July when I opened the bank account (before this I was only vitality). I don't agree with this reason but I let it go.
3. Healthy Foods cashback (February, March, April, May, June 2021 - I got cash backs every month from Woolworths and nothing for July and I am blamed that I only activated this on July when I opened the bank account (before this I was only vitality). I don't agree with this reason. You system did something when I opened the bank account. why would I deactivate this benefit for a month and activate again,
4. Healthy Care: cashback February 2021 - Clicks and nothing from there and I am blamed that I didnt activate this benefit when I opened the bank account (before this I was only vitality). I don't agree with this reason but I let it go. When I try to activate this it does not allow. I give Discovery my clicks card number and they also can't link it and blame me that my details are different with clicks. I call clicks to ensure all details are the same and it doesnt help. then they come back and say I have no clicks card. I send them a copy of my clicks card. I keep on bringing this up and I am told this is countrywide issues and other customers are having the same issue. Now, My bank app shows that I am eligible for 10%, I cannot make clicks my preferred company. 

I am honestly tired of the responses, I am getting with Discovery. The motto, is to blame the client. and not fix the issue. 
Horrible customer service. 
Ever since I opened the bank, everything is a mess. I asked them to manually calculate all the benefits I missed due to their delays but that won't happen. 
Please close my bank account. I can't deal anymore. ",1
"Fixed deposit matured yesterday, bank has still not paid out the funds. They have clear instructions to release funds into my savings account and close the deposit and even sent several reminders that this would be carried out. 

Today, funds still locked up, no interest credited and no funds paid out. Appalling. Best they could do after a call was a generic email to say that the ""system"" team was looking at it. This is unhelpful when one is out of pocket. This is the most basic of banking procedures and they cannot even get it right, this after billions spent on setting up ",1
"I have a Discovery Credit Card and wanted to take out a Discovery Card Protector, to ensure my outstanding credit amount is covered should something to me.  I called Discovery Bank about 3 times and was informed I needed to speak to Discovery Life. Then Discovery informed me I need speak to Discovery Ensure. The Discovery Ensure informed me I needed to speak to Discovery Bank.  After being transferred several time I JUST DISCOVERED that Discovery NO LONGER OFFERS the DISCOVERY CARD PROTECTOR for those who has Credit Cards with Discovery. Not even the call center agents I spoke with was aware of this. SHOCKING. I hope Discovery reminds and inform their Credit Card Holders that they no longer offer the DISCOVERY CARD PROTECTOR product. When I spoke with an agent in the Discovery Life Department about what products Discovery to cover my outstanding balance on my credit Card she was very nonchalant and told me a life cover. Did not even offer a quote.  I will be paying of my Credit Card soonest and go with a bank that offers a Credit Card Protection. SHOCKING",2
I logged a complaint over a month ago and still no resolution! SO it seems not only is the client services & back office staff incapable of doing their jobs but so is the complaints department!! You have failed to resolve my complaint!!!! Im highly dissapointed,1
"worst service imaginable ....

made a purchase on takealot using discovery miles , the cost got charged twice by discovery , this can happen ... not an issue .
then i called discovery and explained the situation , i was told they can see there was a double debit and it should reverse automatically , no problem !
three days later nothing reversed , called back , passed around to three different people , eventually some woman tells that there is nothing she can do and she must log the complaint and it will take 6 days to give feedback , this had now taken 46 min to get that result ... she certainly didnt care about my time waisted ... anyway northing i could do as discovery is the almighty king and i have to just hope they will get back to me ...

two weeks later i sent a mail enquiring about the process , got a generic reply to say one of the bankers would call me , 
next day no call was received ... 

today i call back .... currently in the 58 th minute waiting for them to do something , was put on hold for 37 min only to be told that they sent an email to follow up ... 37 min to send a mail , but that was ok , they said they apologize , that was somehow meant to make it all ok .

now im told they will call me latger after they follow up ....

what did they do for two weeks while the issue was escelated ...?
nothing , thjey dont seem to have any clue why i would be upset that they have wasted my time on three occasion for the same issue and still havent resolved it nor done anything to compensate the issue ...

abolutely riddiculous , and totaly unnacceptable .

do i reccomend this bank .... hell no !!!

Bank transaction feed to 22Seven has been broken for months. When will Discovery be able to restore its bank feed/API to 3rd party budgeting applications like 22Seven? Utterly disappointing to not get answer to this question and being passed from pillar to post when calling the useless call centre.,1
"About 3 weeks back my Discovery money status dropped from Diamond to Silver.
Upon enquiring I was told that I have a credit card debt of R 70599.00
At first I could not believe this because as I have no such debt on any of my credit cards.
Upon further enquiry I was told that I should contact Experian credit check as they would advise.

It was later revealed that my purchases on 23 May for R 69000.00 that was fully paid off on the 18th of June was not cleared by Experian.

I did provide Discovery with a statement on the 30th of July to show that my account is paid up but NO SERVICE OR ACTION was provided to me.
I followed up 3 times with Discovery and 2 times I was promised a callback but NO SUCH SERVICE existed.
I contacted Experian and they could only help my after 60 days have passed.

In summary

I am penalised by Discovery for having made credit card purchases of R 60 000.00 that was paid up within 30 days.
I am penalised by dropping 2 status levels.
I am penalised by losing out on the Double miles discount between 1-14 Aug.
I am penalised for losing out on my flight discount.
I am penalised for losing out on my exercise goals.
I am penalised for losing out on savings interest rates.

This is absolutely pathetic service from Discovery that my status cannot be fixed even after 55 days of having a clear credit record.

This is a list of all the empty promises discovery made with reference number
********** - The consultant told me that they will phone me back but no success.
********** - provided my credit card statement to Elvey but she did not find it important to solve my query.
********** - No service received.
********** - The consultant promised a call back but she also did not find it valued to phone me back.

Im a very disappointed by having my hands tied behind my back of UNEFFECTIVE PROBLEM SOLVING BY DISCOVERY!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

Again my hands are cut off and CANT DO ANYTHING ABOUT MY HUGE PROBLEM",1

"My Discovery card, like others, has now been moved to Discovery Bank. I managed to get the new card relatively easily but have totally been stuck on not being able to use the Bank app. Because of the card, I have an account with Discovery Bank, however, when I try to go into my account on my phone, it tells me I don't have an account, I must register. So then I try to register and it tells me someone with that cell phone already has an account. There is no winning. I cannot tell you how many times we have spoken to Discovery about this and each time, they say they are going to change something on their side, to please give it a day or two. Now, weeks later, it remains the same and nothing has happened., I don't really see the point of phoning again.... maybe just change my credit card..??

I have applied for a SAVING ACC with discovery. Its literally taking months to open. Blocked profiles and app. Nobody ever calls you back to fix it. They don't even know why i its taking so long. CAN U IMAGINE REAL BANKING. With a blocked profile that takes weeks to resolve and i have not yet even transacted with them. Not worth the wait. So their adverti*****t that it takes seconds is a lie. ,1
"Well on the 24/07/2021 my discovery bank app was locked I have requested on the 28/06/2021 that my number needs to be changed as I don't have the number it was linked with they phoned me that saterday linking my new number on to my profile so that I can receive my OTP to reset my password. Well I am still getting the message ""The ID number you provided doesn't match what we have on record for this cell number. Contact your Discovery service team if your details have changed."" I have phoned discovery every single day regarding this problem and was put on hold for most of the time and getting the same feedback that they are escalating the problem costing me money because they don't phone me to give me feedback and the results still the same. Even the manager of the department didn't have the decency to phone me back to give me feedback after I have spoken to him. How difficult can it be just to change one simple phone number. Today 29/07/2021 the OTP department phoned me to verify me and asked if this is the new number I want to be loaded on to my profile and I said yes, just to hear its going to take 3 working days to be done.

Discovery Bank refuses to refund me for an overpayment on an account or allocate to a different month.

I had already opened my Discovery Bank credit card that month specifically for this purpose. I initially only asked for R10 000 credit, not realising that I needed R15 000 for the Apple Watch benefit. Anyways, I qualified for over R90 000 credit so it should not have been an issue to just increase my limit with R5 000.  I had so send through all my documentation again, even though they had all of this already as my account was opened within the same month (June). And guess what...I am still waiting for my limit to be increased. to this day, I have yet to hear anything from Discovery Bank. Due to Discovery Bank's incompetence, I now have to pay the R1 000 activation fee for my Apple watch. I am regretting opening my Discovery Bank account as the only reason I did so, was for the watch.

"Like many, COVID had an immediate impact on my finances and ability to pay. I did however, make a payment arrangement with Discovery Bank in September last year - which I have stuck to by the cent.
For a while after the arrangement was made  I would receive mails / sms's threatening to hand me over if I did not pay my arrears, and after many complaints, it eventually stopped.
It has started again !!
Every 2nd day, I receive both an email and an SMS  , sometimes at 2 in the morning.
""to avoid us handing you over to debt collectors, please pay ***x immediately""

Every time I speak to a consultant, I am told to send the email  dating back to September that proves an arrangement was made - because there are no notes on the system to say such an arrangement was made. Every consultant promises that they will make such a note. Yesterday, I was told that ""perhaps"" the notes expire after a period of time.

Today - another SMS and an email.

Ironically, I also get an email / sms at the end of each month reminding me to pay - as per the arrangement made !

Is this incompetence , or plain harassment ?? ",1
Discovery Bank refused to reverse a transfer that was made in error to my Iphone benefit even though I logged a call immediately. One of their agents also indicated that she would phone me back by a certain time however she never did. ,1
"Phoned in with a query after something strange happened on my account when I activated my iPhone benefit, more than 4 months ago and unfortunately the perception I have is that if you're not a purple client with Discovery Bank judging by the Hello Peter reviews there's no real service or customer care...

Was promised 3 times that they'll get back to me, have 2 reference numbers (unfortunately didn't write down the first), 3 names of each of the consultants I spoke to and still waiting for a call back as to what is going on with my account. 

The rating system is also flawed. Each consultant is SUPER keen to say ""I assure you we'll get back to you"" and ""Please rate how your query was resolved after the call"" which you end up giving a good rating because, well, the person was friendly and professional and each time confirmed ""they'll get back to me"" right? - WRONG! 

Discovery products are GREAT, that much I can say and when they work I love it, but the customer service from the BANKING perspective if there's a query is terrible!!

Now they are playing innocent and claiming to the Ombudsman that they made me aware of this account. Well they did not and this account remains fraudulent, I wonder when they will force me to use this account, because it seems Discovery Bank enjoys forcing clients to use their products.  It is also amazing that this Document suddenly appeared as soon as I made a case against them via the Ombudsman.  The only Credit Card Contract that I agreed to was signed in 2010, as seeing as I was not made aware of the items that would just be added to my Credit Card this contract is now NULL and VOID.  Until such time that a new contract is provided and I sign it I will not pay this account as it is fraudulent. I have also blocked all further communication from Discovery Bank as I no longer wish to have anything to do with these lying scammers.",1
I’m honestly really very angry with Discovery Bank. My account has been locked now for over 3 weeks because of a alleged fraudulent proof of payment from my account. If there is fraud on my account why would the bank then punish or penalize me in return? This is not the first time I’ve had an incident with discovery bank and each time it happens when I travel. Can they please allow me to move out the funds in that account and then close it for good. This is unacceptable and the gentleman who initially called me never bothered to call me again after this although I called twice after we spoke asking him to call me back. ,1
"I have tried and failed to close my account with Discovery Bank 3 times. In the meantime, they keep adding ""admin costs"" that I have to pay to close the account.

"I have paid up and closed my Discovery Credit card (Reason is another story).
2018, I was promised the account would be closed, I needed to wait cause they accidentally took payment from my FNB account to pay off an already paid up credit card. A year later, trying to call a call centre which cannot call you back to resolve their mistakes, I tried again.  After multiple attempts finally they responded in 2020 that the account in now closed.  Thought finally I am done.  A few months back, this is now 2021, I see bank changes on my FNB account for Discovery credit card fees.  Tried to report to FNB that the debit order is fraudulent, this went no where.  My only way out was to stop the debit order and pay FNB to do so.  Now I get at least 3 threatening emails every month demanding payment from Discovery on a closed account. ",1

"Worst service ever! I had a discovery bank credit card, settled and closed it over a year ago. I am unable to make changes contact details on my discovery health profile because the OTP goes to a number I no longer use.

Written, called and did all to discovery - only discovery bank can change the OTP details for me. No one can help me understand why I still have to deal with discovery bank when I closed the account already. As known in this country, any number you cease to use is recycled and given to someone else. means all my OTP is being possibly sent to someone else right now - putting my personal details at risk. Discovery bank still insists on speaking to me, at their own leisure, how PATHETIC! Explaining that I am only available after hours on my mobile does not help because ""OTP' is a sensitive issue. WOW! Wake up guys, I am not banking with you anymore so how sensitive can this be? Why keep my details when I closed my account with you a long time ago? Ironically, no one has a convincing answer to this question. One agent tells me details are kept for future when I decide to re-join that bank again. Who says I will come back to Discovery bank after this kind of treatment? I will never! It's not my fault that although my details are updated on discovery health, OTP is not updated. Yet you still insist on speaking to me before making any changes. Makes no sense at all. Continue with this disgusting service and loose potential clients. 

your digital support only seem to offer 'call back' - PATHETIC! Why have a number on the website if you can not help clients who call in. Below extract from your website:

"I requested the closure of my Discovery Vitality and Discovery Bank in March 2021 a due to my wanting to move countries. Vitality closed with little effort and a refund of R161.55 that went straight to my Discovery Bank.

It is now July 2021 and my account is still not closed. They have processed an adjustment interest amount of R309.25 for no apparent reason. They claim that I did not meet the minimum payments detailed on my statement by the 3rd of every month. I settled my account on the 18th of January 2021 in full and then I topped up with an additional R9,000 knowing at the time I would be using the card. I made a purchase on the 22nd of January 2021 and apparently the R309.25 is interest charged between the 22nd of January 2021 and the 3rd of February 2021 – 16 days.
“55 days interest free”

The system calculated the interest Discovery OWED ME… but some random person decided a system adjustment should be made and processed a charge.
Beware people! Dispute the adjustments! 
I have evidence of everything I have mentioned including all reference numbers – another crazy thing to be aware is that they change dates – Manipulate data to suit them!

"Unable to change personal details and getting no assistance or feedback from Discovery bank or medical aid.
This problem has been going on for more than a year",1
"Below is a social media post that I tagged discovery in:

“To Discovery South Africa

I would like to publicly express my absolute disgust in my experience with Discovery Bank.

I opened an account a little over a week ago and attempted to make my first online transaction.

The transaction was declined and I was advised to call the number listed on the decline SMS I received.

I then got through to them and asked for assistance in completing the transaction as I had only wanted to use 2% of my available funds.

I spoke to a lady who transferred me to the fraud department as she had said the transaction declined due to suspected fraud.

Once I was transferred to the fraud department I was informed that I was not allowed to make the transaction as the SA Reserve Bank had banned all transactions for trading platforms.

When I asked where this was communicated, I was informed by Sam from the fraud department (who refused to give me his name and surname as a reference for “his own protection”) that it was passed a couple of weeks ago and I could look on the website or take it up with the SA Reserve Bank

I then asked to speak to a Team Leader/Supervisor and I was told that he would call me back within the next hour as he was busy (still waiting for the call…)

Upon doing my own research on the matter, I found that I was lied to and given incorrect information regarding the regulation

Existing regulation does not ""allow for cross-border or foreign-exchange transfers for the explicit purpose of purchasing crypto assets,"" the central bank said on its website.

I attempted to process a transaction for the XM Forex Trading platform which only allows for Commodities and Forex trading and therefore has nothing to do with crypto assets.

Discovery South Africa has therefore prevented me from making an income in these harsh economic times and lied to me for the sole purpose of keeping my money (which they trade with for profit).

This is surely illegal and I would like this matter to be broadcasted as Discovery themselves seem to be more than happy to withhold my own money from me and could not care less about how their horrible service and shady business practices have an impact on my livelihood.

Sincerely ****ed off… “

I was contacted by their Social Media team to provide my ID number so that someone could get back to me.

It’s been a day and a half since I called and I was lied to and still no one has contacted me.

I would not recommend banking with them to my worst enemy ??????

Worst customer service ever it took me over two weeks trying to update my contact number for an OTP since I lost my phone even cost me over R200 airtime while holding forever for friendly consultant not even friendly at all will definitely change this bank so pathetic ,1
"I have been trying to get my debit order details updated with discovery bank for weeks in order to pay for my credit card!!!!

After multiple emails and explaining that the app has never worked for me to update my details in way, a consultant email me a form to update my details.

After waiting a week with no response, I called discovery and the consultant advised that back office said I need to update my details on the app myself. 

Discovery admin has not bothered to email or call me to advise me, but instead refuses to update my details.

How does Discovery expect me to update my details if their app is not even functioning properly!!!!!
This is by far the worst service I’ve recieved by any banking institution!!!! ",1
"Our whole family decided to move to Discovery bank since we have Health & Insurance through them and we never had issues...In fact I boast there insurance whenever I get a chance.

I should have known my account was doomed when I waited for my card twice as long as anyone in the house:( 

I downloaded the app and registered my card...the app worked a few days, the suddenly when I tried to sign in it send an error that the selfie for my account and what they have on record doesn't match.
Then started my nearly two weeks to get the app working, first I was told there was no OTP linked to my phone number - but they verify your identity with a OTP to the registered number and that worked- then I was put through to the fraud dept who couldn't help me because call center didn't escalate the call via email. Another few days pass then I receive a call from someone from Discovery to sort out the OTP problem.
Delete the app and re-install I was told and then everything should work wonderfully...yeh right, three more 20+min calls to Discovery and on Saturday I was told they (Fraud dept) can't even see the system generated code I was send by Discovery when instructing me again to call **********. I was then told IT would need to look into it for me and see why they can't see the code I receive - I'm still waiting for that call.

Today I called again - just to hear nothing can be done by either Fraud or the call center and nothing was escalated before, but they will escalate it for me now - which I don't believe at all.

At this stage all I want to do is close this account and warn as many people as possible against Discovery Bank, they do not provide the same quality service or product as Health and Insure.",1
My debit card account has been locked because my credit card is behind. What bull is that? I already have a arrangement in place and it is two separate accounts so why can't I use my debit card?,1
"Beware of Discovery Bank.

I lost my bank card in 2019 and I am unable to find a way to cancel the account without having to go into their store (inconvenient, not ideal in COVID times) or without sitting forever on their call center line.

I even contacted the only email address on their website - someone in their investment relations team - who did not give me an email address or help resolve my request to leave their behavioural bank..

They are just pathetic: their behavioural banking model has not noticed that it took them >6 months to get me the bank card, and then they have not noticed that I have made a transaction for years. They have the cheek to send me promotional material regularly. There model would be better described as bullying banking.

Pathetic service.

If you sign up with them, remember you were warned.",1
"I am trying to access my banking app for I can transfer funds into an account For which I have a card but the app is under maintenance and there’s nothing I can do. I called the banking hotline and they say then can’t help me. I simply have to wait. So while the app is being maintained by life basically needs to be put on hold because I can’t access my own money. ??? Discovery didn’t even send a message the bank before to warn us of this maintenance schedule! Really disappointed to say the least. I will be closing and moving accounts from this bank. There’s a lot discovery as a whole they can learn concerning customer service as a whole from the bank right through to the medical aid! Years ago Discovery used to be the best but now they are the absolute worst. I regret even trying to give this bank a chance!  What a epic fail!!!!!!

Angry and frustrated.",1
"I have emailed discovery card numerous times for help. Their reply is that they are not replying to emails, but a customer can phone them??!!! What a cheek! I, as a customer, must call them, at my cell phone expense??!! There is absolutely NO REASON that emails from customers CANNOT be answered?! Even worse, they are ignored! Why do they not call emailing customers back, at THEIR EXPENSE???",1
If you believe the media hype that it is possible to open a bank account on line you are severely mislead! It only works if the AI BOT accepts your uploaded details as soon as a manual credit application is required the process grinds to a halt.,1
The account application process is very quick and easy to do. The card is also delivered within 3 days after the application process has been completed.,5

This customer service is shocking. ",1
"Ever since the credit card administration has moved from FNB to Discovery Bank I find the user experience is pathetic. On 3 Jun 2021 my card declined twice whilst shopping at a mall. I called the Discovery Credit Card number to get assistance, I was told my card was locked due to inactivity. I logged the call to unlock and also questioned why am I paying monthly fees if my card is not available to use. The lady gave me a reference number and confirmed my card will be unlocked in the next hour. After waiting almost 2 hrs I attempted to swipe the card again but to no avail. Calling the credit card telephone line again the recorded message said they were closed and I should call during working hrs.
I logged this call on 3 Jun, even tried to use my card later in June whilst grocery shopping and then once for an online purchase but each time it failed. No one from Discovery bank called me about the issue logged so I had to call back end of June and again request escalation. I found that I had to remind them about the call logged, give them the reference number as they did not have visibility of this on the system. I was told this has been escalated and they will get back to me. Still no one got back to me so I called again. During the daily calls I have been doing to follow up I have been told the card is locked due to inactivity, then I get told the card is inactive. It looks like no one even knows why the card is not working. One lady showed me how to go to the website and activate the card but both attempts failed. She then suggested she has now done something on her end and I should log out and then log in again and try but was still not successful. I have given up trying to get the card working. Following up on the reversal of fees, I mean why pay fees if I do not have the facility/service. For this also I have to do all follow up calls. I am told 'No the fees will not be reversed as the card is lock due to inactivity, in fact I have a reminder that I should pay fees for this month. I still cannot use the card. On the 7 July I was called by another Discovery dept, and the guy wanted to arrange with me to drop off a new card. I received this card last year so what is wrong, On the 8th July I am called by another sales person. To date for a call that was escalated on 3 Jun there has been no resolution. Each time I call to follow up on the dispute I get told it is escalated. I am beginning to question the definition of escalation. If I pay the monthly amount even a day late Discovery Bank is quick to penalise but they cannot even uphold their end of the service. More than a month since the call was logged and still no resolution.",1
"Your bank is a disgrace. You are not yet ready to be a financial institution. No one knows what's going on!
You can call me on ********** to discuss further.",1
"I have been trying to ""upgrade"" to Discovery's credit card for days now.  The irony of how impossible and inefficient and user unfriendly process I have been trying to follow is laughable; in fact if I didn't laugh at Discovery's arrogance in giving me this run around, I would cry.  I have had a platinum Discovery Card for years, which was managed by FirstRand in the past.  But it is a stipulation to switch to the Bank if one wants to qualify for the Apple Watch vitality benefit, which is my primary goal.  The reason why I can't upgrade I am told, is that my cellphone number is listed as my secondary not primary number.  Not only has Discovery card been using this number for years, but this is there mix up not mine.  When I went onto their website, there are no instructions to follow as to how to do it & the call centre insisted that I do it myself.    This is old style bureaucracy at its most inefficient, pointless worst.",2
"I cannot believe that level of service from a bank that punts itself to be a bank of the future. I sent an email on 02.03.2021 to *********** for the Attention of Busi, who asked me to send the email and mark for her attention, regarding a matter that was referred to the NCT. I need permission from Discovery to send communications via email. I did not get a response, so i sent the email again on 08.03.2021. Still no response. On 06.05.2021 I sent the very same email again. And as you would have it - No response. I call in and am pushed from pillar to post and still have no response. I try to explain my issue to Nkosinathi today and he tells me to be specific. I told him that I had already told him my issue and he continues to say I need to be specific. And then he rambles on not giving me a chance to explain to him. Then I ask for a chance to speak, then he continues to speak. I asked how was I going to tell him what my problem was when he was speaking over me all the time. The call ended badly with me telling him that he was stupid. The frustration is just too much. All I want is a reply to my email for 4 months now. Cannot believe how useless this bank actually is. ",1
"No one ever calls me back. Very poor service. I keep loading requests , no one calls me back. The person in charge of the social media queries also has no idea what they are doing ... Service is terrible. All I want to do is join the bank but no one wants to assist me . ",1
"I would like to report and inform all those who are planning to open up a bank account with Discovery NOT TO DO IT!!!! 
I requested to have my account closed on the 4th of March 2021. Discovery decided to charge me R309,25 for ""Interest charged Adjustment"" but had no adjustment requested and my account was paid in full. When I phone to ask them what that amount was for and they could not give me an answer. The continuously phoned me back after ""investigating"" and when it didn't make sense I questioned it and was answered by ""I will have to find out and get back to you"" as they could not explain it or understand it themselves. It has been FOUR MONTHS and I am still begging and pleading to have my account closed! They said ""I will find out and call you back"" every time I call and ask why it is not closed yet. As you probably guessed they do not bother to get back to anybody. 

I am now reporting them everywhere I can to avoid anybody else from having the same problem or similar. 

I have five different reference numbers that mean nothing to me as nobody bothers to assist. 

My sister also had troubles and was charged twice for her card. It took her 3 months to close her account and Discovery Bank put a black dot on her name after not paying the amount that was overcharged. 

Discovery Bank will do nothing but rob from you and name and shame your name after you refuse to pay the amount that they overcharge you. 

Please go somewhere else! Do NOT open an account!!!!!",1

I had discovery insurance many years ago and thought perhaps I had created a profile then. Went to website to reset password and no sms, no email. Called discovery bank. ID is linked to a completely different number and email that isn’t mine. Went to three departments, no none can assist me in fixing this and I can’t do it from side cause I’m not getting the links. It makes no sense whatsoever ever that it can be amended correctly in the banking side, which means my ID number was used fraudulently to open a profile. ",1
"I have NO idea anymore what it takes to effect a cancellation on ANY of Discovery's products. For his sins, my husband had a Discovery Credit Card when it was still in the hands of FNB Visa. In the years since we have tried to cancel this card, we have probably paid about R3,500 - R5,000 in monthly and annual fees. We have completed their forms (which they usually hide behind). We have asked Discovery to PROVE when we last received a card and to PROVE when the card was last used by my husband. They can't so instead they add fees onto fees onto fees and now claim he owes more than R822. We do not have a card, we do not want a card and you are destroying the name of the company whom I have held my medical aid with for more years than I care to mention. It is daylight robbery pure and simple. Rectify it. Apologise for it and refund him for every single fee you have taken since he ceased to use the  card.",1

Waited for the entire week with no response. I then contacted them and spoke to Musi Ndlovu on the 02-07-2021 of which i was then told he would have a look and once again needed more time.

"I have been banking with Discovery since the bank opened.
I have always kept my credit record intact and have always prepaid my credit card in advance.
Recently Nedbank changed their website and from which I had always made payment.
Discovery is listed on their website as a defined beneficiary and was used for purposes of making payment.
A few days later I called Discovery as I saw the payment did not reflect.
This was followed by 6 emails and a further 5 telephone calls to resolve this matter but which was never done.
Apparently the deposit was found in a FNB suspense account and they just could not attend to the transfer between banks for some reason which seems to be sheer incompetence. 
The calls made also require verification by way of a pin which is forwarded by sms but which you never receive in time and which then requires a manual verification which is extremely frustrating.
Out of sheer frustration I then sent email no 7 threatening to cancel the card and viola it was done in an instant and without even a call.
My suggestion after having this shocking experience is that they should rather opt out of the banking sector and rather focus on their core business and it seems that their service levels are non existent or their staff are incompetent ",1

How wrong we were.  I am furious and he feels that he isn't good enough to have an account.  He has been working now for 3 years, earns a great salary.  Maybe Discovery doesn't want the youth. So maybe he should move on.  He choose to bank with Discovery!!!!! Now I feel that only a senior manager should be in touch with him to explain why every document he has uploaded has been declined.  Discovery, why are you wasting so much money on advertising?",1

No complaints, just a few comments. My daughter received her card today, thank you, we now have a second family member banking with discovery.
1. When are you going to launch a youth account? My son is only 11 and can't open an account, and trying to open with other banks when I don't bank with them is impossible. So he currently doesn't have a bank account for him to learn to manage his money.
2. When are you going to launch homeloans and vehicle financing? As your loyal clients, and happy ones at that, we are tired of being abused by other banks as we try get home financing. Wouldn't it be easier if all my products were with my bank? 

Thank you in advanceKe",5
"I have had THE worst experience trying to close my credit card facility. It has now been over a week since my original request, and I still haven't received a final confirmation of the closure. 
My original request (**********) was processed within few days, but an error was made on Discovery's part as they have processed my request incorrectly, closing the transaction account instead of the credit card as originally requested. Following up on the matter numerous times (**********, **********, ********** and a few more of which I don't have reference numbers), I was ensured that they have escalated the matter and that it has been marked as urgent since our current home loan application is pending the formal confirmation of the closure. 
It has now been a week with numerous calls since the second request, and I've only received a notice (01 Jul 2021 4:53 PM) that the account has been locked as it was about to be closed. This morning (02 Jul 2021 2:55 AM), I received another notification that I've missed a minimum payment due and should make a payment to avoid penalties, even though the credit card was paid in full when making the closure request.

This is absolutely unacceptable and, quite frankly, ridiculous!!! How is it even remotely possible that it should take this long to rectify an error made on Discovery's part? There is just no logic to it! I am saddened and heavily disappointed as a longstanding customer of Discovery and such a ""prestine"" blue-chip corporation.",1
Individual tax season is opening tomorrow 1 July 2021 and still no IT3(B) tax certificate available from Discovery Bank. I have phoned and on two occasions was told that the certificates was in the process of being loaded. Very frustrating because my other Discovery certificates was received on time.,1
Really not a great experience. I tried to open a credit card facility. Not because I needed one but I wanted to open it in order maximise my Vitality Rewards. I downloaded the app and selected the credit card option. I provided the necessary documents and yet I still had requests to provide the same documentation days later. Fast forward to now and they opened a transactional account in error. I then had to sit with 3 different operators where they then said it will take 8 working days to close the incorrect account and I still need to pay the R165 opening fee for the wrong account.  The operator very rudely said I selected the wrong option therefore I should pay. The operators seem to be unhelpful and very unfriendly. ,1
So Discovery bank where is my salary... If the 26th falls on weekday my money is always available after 12am on gbe 26th...now when the 26th falls on a Saturday then the discovery agent tells me I will only get my salary on Monday. All other employees who banks with different banks received there salary but only discovery bank employees haven't received there salary so please explain what's going on ,1

"Discovery bank repeatably blocks your credit card for no reason, then you have to contact them to reactivate your card. I've been waiting for hours for them to do that, but no joy.

"I spent a quite while on the phone on Jun 14 '21 at around 2:05pm trying to establish why my payment online for an overseas hotel was being declined.

It was ""quite while on the phone"" because I received several contradictory reasons from the agent ~ and only at the end did he tell me that ""SUCH PAYMENTS CAN NO LONGER BE MADE ON THIS CARD BECAUSE OF RESERVE BANK REGULATIONS""

I find that difficult to believe especially in light of the fact that none of my friends and associates have ever heard such... !!

Aside from not being in a position to answer the question clearly in the beginning without the duck-n-dive antics...

CAN DISCOVERY BANK CONFIRM THAT THIS IS TRUE AND CORRECT?",1
"I have been a Discovery clients for years. I have Discovery Medical Aid, Discovery Insure and Vitality. I have Diamond status on Vitality, and decided to maximize my benefits. In order to do this, I need a Discovery Credit Card. I previously had a Discovery bank account that I closed, as the offering was not aligned to what I needed in a bank. Now... I have come back to apply for a credit card in order to maximize my Vitality experience. This is where the nightmare began. 

I applied for a credit card on the Discovery App
I wanted a Gold Credit Card, but Discovery only gave me Platinum as an option
I call Discovery... they say because I previously had a Platinum card, my options default to Platinum and they can’t override it. I need to apply for a downgrade after I receive my card.
I go ahead and apply for the Platinum Card (this is not what I want)
I upload my supporting documents
I get an email requesting me to upload additional documents on the app
I go to the app and there is no place for me to upload documents, it just says “Application in process” with no hyperlink
I call Discovery... they say that’s odd, and give me an email address to submit additional documents
I do the above
Discovery calls me requesting for my documents to be uploaded
I inform them I have already sent documents
Discovery confirms my application has been processed, please accept offer on the App
I open the app, again... there is nothing to approve. it just says “Application in process” with no hyperlink
I call Discovery... they log a query... nothing
I call Discovery.... they escalate... nothing
Discovery emails me to inform me my offer is expiring
I call Discovery... they escalate again... nothing
I call Discovery... The escalate and expediate and fast track... nothing
I call Discovery... they log an escalated query... nothing
I call Discovery...
I call Discovery...
I call Discovery...
At this point, more than a month has passed.
I call Discovery... they ask me to delete the application and start the process again
I call Discovery... I ask them to guarantee that this time, it will work.... because my landing page looks the same after the re-download
They say yes, it will work
I do the above
I now need to upload documents. Again, it just says “Application in process” with no hyperlink. 

This is embarrassing. 
I would just like to maximize on the benefits that I have earned... and the longer this takes, I assume you will compensate for benefits lost.  
Again, please fix.  ",1

"Good day

I just have a quick question regarding your credit card budget facility, how do I make online pirchases and put them on the budget facility? If I may make an example, I have been using FNB as well and when making online purchases as soon as you enter your card number when making online purchases it gives you 2 options for budget and straight, then you can select the number of months you can take to pay back…but I haven’t seen anything like that with your card…is there a way to make online purchases go on to the budget facility??

"With all banks operating and providing a full suite of services to their clients, Discovery Bank is the only bank still not operating during Covid at full capacity. The Sandton Branch is still after 1.5 years closed 'due to Covid regulations'. 

When you walk into Discovery inc, you can get a coffee at the coffee shops, you can get a meal and you can receive services from all departments, except the bank. This makes no sense since banking is classified as an essential service.

I've phoned Discovery Bank multiple times, to confirm when they will open their branch services with the same answer 'we don't know, we are following Covid regulations'. 

Discovery Bank is the only bank that advertises (falsely) they offer Home Affairs services but does not deliver these services, because their branch is closed for the past 1.5 years. Discovery clients are forced to queue at the Department of Home Affairs as Discovery Bank refused to open its only branch in Sandton to deliver the services they promise their clients. 

This is unacceptable! False advertising, and underdelivering. I'm extremely annoyed that my husband and my son was able to get their passports, ID's etc. sorted through FNB, and I'm not. I'm forced to open a bank account with FNB to get the basic services Discovery Bank promise to offer to their clients. 

Can someone PLEASE explain to me why your bank is still closed when all other banks are operational and offering their clients a full suite of services? 

Can you confirm why your office building is open, and you can purchase coffee and food, you can sort out your medical aid and insurance but you cannot do any of your banking?

Please explain this logic!",1
"I have been a Discovery Bank client for two years now, I have been trying to figure out how to activate my rewards with vitality money since I am paying for this product every month. I keep getting a message saying that I do not qualify for this service. Today I phoned them to get this sorted, the banker who helped me was very unhelpful and sounded like she would rather be anywhere else, I asked her to put me through to someone else since she is not assisting me with my query but rather keep repeating what sounded like a script for every question I asked, her reply was that she can not transfer me to someone else. I asked how I can activate my rewards with vitality money to which she replied I need to have a credit card, which is not what is stated on the app that says you need to have a suite or credit card or any transactional account with bundled pricing. Now I do not qualify for a credit card nor do I want one, I mentioned this to the banker to which she replied that that is the only way to activate the rewards. This was false information and I feel cheated by Discovery bank since they are making me pay for a service (Vitality Money, according to the banker is compulsory) that according to them I can not use because I do not qualify for a service which is required to activate the said product. At this stage, I would rather close my account and put my money elsewhere since the main pulling point of Discovery bank is getting rewarded for your banking, which I am not and in the end, it just costs me money.

"I had the worst experience with Discovery bank, i phoned them last week Monday to join the bank, but i got issue with cell phone verification, the banker told me just give us 48 then we will solve the issue, i was waiting them to call me back but no one did, so i was phoning everyday to check and every time the banker telling me that give us 2 hours then we will phone you back and as usual no one did, they told me they escalated to the managers and it will be sorted soon, but after 1 week of waiting still they did nothing and today the banker she told me the same ( i will call you back after 1 PM to give you update but she didn't ).

"I would like to express my deepest dissapointment in discovery bank.In 2017 I have a life policy with Discovery and they informedthat if i open a bank account i can buy my healthy foods on this card and ill get points and rewards.At the time I worked for a broker who represented discovery life,investment,insure and all other products.They delivered my card but Discovery bank was not launched then.Now 4 years later i recieved an email early this year stating R100 is outstanding which I owe to discovery.4 months later i get another email stating i now owe them R1200.I posted on the discovery facebook page and they informed I must inbox them and so i did and left my contact details.They never called me and a month later my bank inform discovery bank tried to debit my bank account for R500.According to my knowledge a client must give written consent enable to deduct their account.I never signed a debit orderdocument but discovery sent a request to my bank.How they manage to do that,i do not know.I think this is very concerning to all clients to be vigilant if they want to join discovery or take out any of their products.Seems like Discovery is just ignoring my callback request.I tried callingthe call centre and when i gave my details the agent just hanged up.I think the best option is to report this to the ombud to get this resolved as this matter cannot be resolved internally and I am getting the worst service i have ever had with any company.in the meantime my credit record is suffering because of this matter.Does anyone else has such problems with Discovery?",1

"This is the most inconvenient and incompetent bank I have ever come across in my life.. It took months for them to be able to even help me open the bank account in the first place because none of the consultants seem to know how to capture an email address and phone number.. Once my account was open, all was well except for the fact that you can't send ""ewallets"", not all banks have Discovery bank listed on their apps and you cant withdraw from certain atms. I was okay with that because they weren't stealing money from me unlike some other banks that I won't mention right now because the focus is on the Discovery . Anyway, don't join this bank because if your phone gets hacked or stolen Discovery will not assist you with changing your phone number and email address which will leave your money vulnerable, don't join this bank because if you put in a withdrawal notice on the app from an investment account they will cancel it without your knowledge or concent, do not join discovery bank because their consultants get rid of you by promising to call you back to assist you further but they never do, instead they leave work before their supposed to and then your urgent query will have to wait until they feel like tending to it. Do not join discovery bank because their consultants/bankers do not know how to tend to queries, they do not seem to have a sense of cohesion in their work place which would make helping clients much simpler. Their departments work as separately as possible to ensure that you end up giving up on making any queries... I'm still waiting for them to cancel my account by the way.. apparently I have to wait for them to call me to cancel my account and also gain access to my funds. ",1

Waiting on the line for 10 minutes to talk to a manager. but no response.  FNB by the other hand would have assisted me with the debit order switching from my Nedbank.

They have cheapened the offering by ""training"" call-center agents that can't understand basic financial fundamentals / seriousness unless its on script.  After I'm finished each call (I'm sure they are cutting me off), they ask me if there's ""anything else you would like help with?"" - as if I'd like fries with that?.

Discovery Bank really stealing your monthly money.  They claim you can do everything online but if you want to close your account there is no help no online no nothing but they take your money very quickly every month.  So i phone in on my cost answer the questions that the automation already asked.  The operator is adamant that i must give a good reason to close my account after i said i want it closed as of today.  Her answer somebody might phone me in 72 hours.  DISCOVERY BAD  ,1

"Appaling service. I have a gold credit card that expired in February this year. I was advised to download the discovery bank app and order a new card there. This failed.

When I called I was told that my credit record is poor so they cannot issue me with a new card. So effectively I have an account with them that is paid up but I have no use for the credit card account. Sinister and nonsensical to say the least.

Avoid them at all costs, they are big on marketing and terrible in customer service.",1

Why does it take 5 minutes to open the account, but when you want to close it, it’s harder than getting blood from a chickens tooth?",1
"Joining discovery was a mistake. I joined them almost 1 year ago. Since then, I have had numerous problems. Discovery consistently, and without exception, fails to respond to or resolve in any way, including a previous Hello Peter post from last year. I'm confident to express that the situation has not improved, only worsened, and that I deeply regret joining discovery. Once, they even said to me ""give us another chance"", but they've gotten worse. 

Most recently, they have blocked my account. I believe that this is for no reason other than an incompetent behind a computer. 

On 3 April 2021, a Discovery representative called me at about 18:00 on a Friday. Already, I do not believe that this is an appropriate time for a bank to make an important call. So when the rep asked if it was a convenient time for me, I said no. She asked if we could communicate by email. After receiving such poor communications from Discovery in the past, I properly asked her if she would actually reply. She said of course she would reply but, of course, she didn't! No surprises there Discovery... 

Well, that's not entirely true... She did reply almost an entire month later! I can't believe Discovery can function like this... The email concernes my tax obligations. When I joined Discovery, I put my source of income as ""foreign income"" since I had been working in China prior to the pandemic. Discovery wanted some FICA information from me. Fair enough... But... They did not state what FICA information they required AND I am presently unemployed. So that exactly what I sent in response to the discovery rep. 

As previously stated, it took almost 1 month for the rep to reply. Despicable however, she very clearly stated that I did not need to worry about providing any documents since I declared that I'm presently unemployed. So despite waiting for almost a month, my mind was at ease. 

Last week (3 June 2021), Discovery promptly told me that they had blocked my account since I had not provided FICA documents! 

My goodness... What shambles of a mess you have made, Discovery. It is clear and obvious that I not in the wrong in any way. It is clear and obvious that Discovery representatives demonstrate gross incompetence and negligence in handling their clients' affairs. You're messing with my money!! MY MONEY!!! 

Furthermore, I have been trying to get Discovery to call me back for 1.5 years in regard to a great many things. I don't think your staff know how to dial a phone... Additionally, I called Discovery to get MY MONEY back, yet my issue is unresolved. Innocentia said she would call me back, but she didn't! What the heck am I supposed to do Discovery?? I can't resolve what ever issue you've got with me, if you don't tell me what I need to do or provide. Ridiculous institution... 

I would like to know exactly who the representatives are who are responsible for this disaster. 
AND! I would like to know what actions Discovery will take on these representatives for this disasterous outcome and incomprehensibly poor service.
AND! I would like a formal, written, and signed apology from the CEO.
AND! Of course, I want my account unblocked so that I can access my money!!!

I'll reiterate, YOU'RE MESSING WITH MY MONEY!!!",1
"I wrote on this blog about 2 months ago, complaining about Discover Bank. up until now. nothing has been done to resolve this issue, the only people to call/text me is still the private company who call on debtors for Discovery Bank.

my ex wife has communicated with her bank, and they not sure of what Discover Bank is wanting, my ex wife has apparently sent emails to Discover Bank asking them to contact her and/or the person who she has been dealing with at the bank. typical new south Africa, nothing has happened.

but We still get the private company calling/texting us everyday.

LARRY, from discovery Bank Has not contacted me once, since the last posting, to try to do something from his side, regarding this account, you sit on the phone for God knows how long, trying to get through to Discovery Bank, to speak to Larry or any person that has any knowledge of what they are doing, but unfortunately, there dose not seem to be anyone there that is competent enough, I have asked them to ask Larry to contract me on numerous occasions, NOTHING HAPPENS.

I want one of the managers to call me, not someone in charge of the section, but someone who knows the situation and knows what should be done and to listens to us when we ask to call us to resolve this situation.

I hope that this happens,

I am getting totally annoyed with this bank and staff.  I spent ages on the phone to a lady who agreed to close my account.  I was previously told how to cancel my credit card which eventually happened but still Discovery Bank kept charging.  The lady said she would ask for a manual closure of the account today.  I will receive notification of closure.  Now I see they refuse to close unless I pay two months charges when i did not have the card running.  Discovery bank is a shark and are totally useless.  I never asked to join so I cannot even say it was the worst decision I made because I never made the decision to join in the first place.  I refuse to pay for something that should never have been charged.  This account should have been close a long time ago.,1

"Absolutely disgusted by the service I received. 

I opened a credit card account with Discovery Bank with the intention of utilising the Vitality Active Rewards Apple Watch reward. I was then incorrectly given a transactional account with a credit facility instead of a credit card. Numerous calls to the call centre resulted in no plausible way to change it to a credit card which was originally requested.

I now lose the activation fee paid, and should I go through the whole process again I then have to pay an additional activation fee due to the negligence of Discovery Bank. Not only this, but numerous credit checks have an affect on my credit record. ",1

A customer service representative assured me that I could make an international payment to pay off my credit card. When I did so, it did not go through and was later told, international payments cannot be made! It took me weeks to track my money. My international bank apologised profusely for delays and made a decent good will payment.
Whereas Discovery Bank have taken no responsibility- for giving me incorrect information, for not responding to emails, ignoring my complaints and not providing information post their investigation.  This has been going on since the beginning of May and they still have the cheek to deduct interest for delayed payment! 
Their customer service is non- existant and they should stick to health services not financial services as they are incapable of running a bank.

"Good Day Discovery Bank

You are advertising lots on You Tube currently so I wanted to open an account.  I then asked about the 10% Equity which you promised to blacks.  You then asked me how black I am and then it turned out I am not black enough.  I am very very disappointed in you.... ",1
"On the 8th April I was involved in a car accident and thus was required to rent a car. My insurer, Discovery Insure pointed me to Avis. I went to the Avis Gautrain branch, filled out the paperwork and swiped my Discovery Credit Card (received a slip) and R1500.00 was placed on hold. Contrary to what various Discovery Bank agents have told me, the money left my account and my available balance decreased by R1500.00. On the 13th May, I returned the car to Avis and they said they would contact the bank to release my deposit. Today is the 29th May and I am yet to receive my deposit back and see my balance increase. I have spoken to multiple agents, who either said they would escalate and contact me back, said they would call me back at a certain time with feedback of who simply just put the phone down on me. Three key role-players who either failed to provide me feedback by the time they stated or who simply put the phone down on me are Goipse from the servicing department, Kingsly from the escalations team and Girshwin from the social media department. I had a heated conversation with Girshwin where he told me I was wrong and didn't know what I was talking about and that the money could not have been taken because it does not reflect on any statement. He further told me, that a holding deposit does not reflect on a statement or recon so he and Discovery Bank would NOT help me with my matter because I didn't have proof. I sent him a picture of my receipt but he told me it doesn't match his records. Not sure how a receipt with my details and card details don't match their records. When he decided that he wasn't going to help me, he put the phone down. Before he put down on me, he told me that a holding deposit is only valid for 7 days if not banked with the merchant and thus it was returned to my account on the 15th April. Not true. On the 20th May, Avis emailed Discovery to release the deposit and on that same day, Ayanda stated it would be released. Tell me, what rental company would let their cars out for a month but only have the deposit valid for 7 days??

I am an avid Discovery member, holding a variety of products with them however this latest interaction has left me with a sour taste that I am probably going to be moving away from Discovery as a whole.",1
"0n the 19th of this month Discovery bank promised to get their Fraud department to come  back to me regarding a potential fraud issue. 

Here we are 9 days ( 7 working days) later and not a whisper. 

",1
"Tried to get assistance. The verification process that they have in place is so cumbersome, that I could not get assistance due to the fact that I could not be verified, even though I gave them all my personal info. Worse than government. Wish I never opened an account with them.",1
"I cancelled my credit card with them as they informed me in writing on how to do this.  When account paid up login to the website and cancel the card.  This I did and lo and behold they issue me with another bill for charges.  I want no part in Discovery Bank, never wished to and never signed anything or gave verbal permission for them to make me a member of Discovery bank.

If they continue in this manner I will address it again with the legal team as they have no right to charge when I followed their instructions to cancel the card and have no further dealings with Discovery Bank.

They do not respond to these reviews because they know they are in the wrong.
Just remove me from your horrid bank once and for all and I will be the happiest person alive.",1
"I was heavily disappointed about the service I've received from Discovery!!!

Ive received an email from Discovery stating that..'' Plus, if you add a Discovery Bank credit card to your banking portfolio before 22 February 2021, you'll get 5 000 Discovery Miles, guaranteed! Remember that 10 Discovery Miles equals R1.

This email clearly states that if a client executes what is required from them, they will receive 5000 bonus miles. 
And so I did exactly that, but to my disappointment after many call backs and queries I was not honored the 5000 miles because the promotion only started on the 21 of Jan and I applied on the 19th of Jan.

If one reads the email in clear and simple terms that is not what the email is saying. Secondly there is no indication to the client that there is any condition to this statement. There is also no asterisk that normally refers a person to a specific set of conditions of when the promo started.


This is poor and pathetic service from Discovery Bank!!!!",1
"I am so ****ed as I write this. I wanted an iPhone 12 Pro Max that is priced at R24 699. As a Discovery client , I thought it would be best I open a discovery credit card because I already have a transaction account, vitality, and discovery car insurance. Before I applied , I called them to explain my reason for wanting to open the credit card with them, that I want to take an iPhone and that I will be closing my FNB credit card for this particular reason. Cool - they said I should apply on the app, which I did. I qualified for R32 000 but I took R25 000 because the iPhone I want is R24 699. After they approved, I realized that the iPhone benefit says I only qualify for an iPhone of R19000. I called Discovery again to ask why is that. They mentioned that I must have a buffer of R5 000 remaining in my credit card. Meaning if I take an iPhone of R24 699, my credit card must be left with R5000 in it. I asked the agent on the call that if I add R5000 from my account will it be okay, she said yes it’s okay. I added R5000 then I drove to iStore to get the phone. iStore said they can’t give me the phone because the iPhone benefit on Discovery app says I qualify for R19000 . I called Discovery and I got another agent who told me that adding R5000 won’t assist, I need to be having an extra R5000 from the credit facility I applied for. Meaning I need to increase my credit or should’ve just taken R32000 I qualified for initially. I asked her to cancel my credit card and she said she’ll have to log a query with the credit department, I asked if she can transfer me to the credit department and she said they don’t have a direct phone, I asked if I can cancel on the app and she said that functionality is not available now. 

I would like to make Discovery aware that they wasted :

1. My airtime
2. Petrol 
3. Messed up my credit score for nothing 
4. My time

I am so disappointed with your service. These agents that all work for Discovery have different information, it’s weird because I assume they went to the same training and they were given similar information. I should’ve used my FNB card mxm.",1
"Discovery Bank seem to promise the world but deliver nothing..

Their staff are not trained and for months I have been puzzled at the fact that my account is debited a day after I pay for my credit card... only to find out that my account has been set that way.

After HOURS on the phone, consultant after consultant, no one apparently knew that I could cancel my debit order, that I didn't create. I was just advised that my money couldn't be reversed.",1
"Stay away from Discovery bank!!! I have been with Discovery Bank about a month and after lots of promises, after duping me into upgrades etc for better rewards and interest rates, they drop my savings interest rate today by 0.5%.  This was done by no formal communication other than the lamest sms, offering no reasons for the drop.  They duped and deceived me - stay away from them!!!  They lured me in with great interest rate promises, and after a lot of effort changing banks, they dropped the rates. ***???!!  I got my girlfriend to switch to them as well  - I feel like an idiot now!  Well done Discovery, well played you skelms!!!",1
"I posted the review below on the 1st of March 2021, whereby I received a quick response by Sibongile on the review followed by a phone call from Nashan.  Nashan had a lot of promises to solve this matter and committed that he would provide feedback within a week.  Needless to say, more than two months later, I have not received any feedback from Sibongile or Nashan.  It is very disappointing.  In the meantime I pay interest on the debt due to the fraud.

I reported suspected fraudulent transactions of more than R10 000 to Discovery fraud department in October 2020.  It took weeks to get any feedback from the investigating officer (Abel).  I was only provided feedback after I re-register the same fraudulent case and numerous requests for Abel to provide feedback.  To date I only received roughly R2 500 back from discovery.  I called and sent numerous emails again and after speaking to Abel probably 4 weeks ago he promised to give me feedback the following day, but I am still waiting for the feedback.  All the required information and even more was provided, but still nothing is happening.  I will probably lodge a new case and hopefully I will get some feedback and conclude this matter in the near future.  I am definitely not referring Discovery Bank to anyone because their fraudulent department service is very poor.   There is no means of escalating the matter to the responsible person's supervisor.  I requested that on numerous occasions and every time the supervisor is in a ""meeting"".",1
"Discovery Bank is a jerk for charging me an R500 account fee when I haven't used my savings account in 5 months and have sent reminders to the bank to terminate my account, but nothing has been done.",1
"Shameful lack of compassion fraud dept. 5 weeks ago I was held hostage by 5 armed men , stripped naked and over 4 hours of humiliation and threats to my life , proceeded to withdraw the balance of my credit card , payments to African bank and Qwagga mall atm, while mms from the site , held against my will every transaction had one assailant knife threatening hold phone close up for face recognition and fingerprint ident , thereby allowing the transaction to proceed . I had zero alternative but to comply. For this bank to call in spite of this traumatic event and theft tell me the Committee has decided to not accept accountability and expect the SAPS to recoup funds from criminals is absurd , in the time it’s taken to write this , the bank had made this money back in interest . If dead then what , same cold response , insurance would surely cover .. Ive always paid my oD on time and generally more than asked for min payment due . I ask for some compassion in reversing the amount stolen . I’m in counselling for trauma the stress is beyond me, nothing I asked for in life",1
"training/ [competency?] of general staff is really poor
AND/... there is no way to escalate or talk to a supervisor/ senior person

Even the old Discovery Card was better than this!!",2
I wish I could give this bank a ZERO rating. Account suspended. 7 months down the line and still NO feedback not a single call from anyone working at discovery bank. Absolutely appaualing and pathetic! I asked to have this account closed with immediate effect as it is now affecting my credit record. This was TWO damn weeks ago. I am absolutely ****ed!!!!!! No common decency! This bank is disgusting,1
"I need to say a huge thank you and give credit where it’s due, Peter Ditshego & Tanya Kewley. Such smooth, efficient and incredible service from these two. It was such a pleasure to deal with them, I highly commend them and I hope Discovery do too !!! ",5
"Absolute waste of time!!! 

Will be closing this account soon , bought data via the app money went through but data was not received. Phoned twice and the problem is still not solved after 2 weeks!!! ",1
"I had an issue with my apple pay and because of that my account never registered a transaction before 6 April and I never got the bonus 2 500 miles. I called in a couple of times to try resolve why apple pay was not working before the due date, but nothing came of it. 
Since then I have called a few times and each consultant tells me they escalating my miles query and will call me with an outcome. Not one has called me back and its still pending. This week I called again, promised the same thing and still NOTHING!!!!
This kind of service is shocking and I will endeavour to close my account as soon as I can. I have had constant issues with my account from opening to now.
The black account is not worth the amount you pay for it!",1
"When Discovery Credit Card moved away from FNB to Discovery Bank, they added more accounts to what they call Full Banking Suite. The consultant guides you through the change telephonically but doesn't even bother to explain what that means for me as a customer. When I realized that I now had more accounts, I called Discovery Bank to cancel all the newly added accounts, and I was told they do not have the functionality to do that, however, they will reverse the charges associated with these accounts. Now a year later I'm told I can close the accounts but there are charges that I need to settle before they do, ***?? Firstly I did not ask for additional accounts, secondly, I did not even make use of these accounts that were forced onto me, now I'm expected to pay some stupid interest charges. This bank is ripping off its customers.",1
"I switched my bank account from Capitec to discovery . I sign up for a  gold cheque account. This week I wanted to apply for a personal loan. I call Oldmutal and Capitec they both had approved amounts for me however,when I told them I’m banking with  discovery bank. I was  told they can’t process my application because discovery won’t approve their direct debit request.

 My last call was to discovery to add a overdraft. They declined my application claiming I miss one payment this year for Woolworths. 

When I done my 5 min sign up why didn’t discovery bank advise me they  don’t have capacity to assist with outside banking systems?  

This only means i add 3 credit checks on my profile this month which will reflect on my credit report for the next 12 months .  ",1
I done a application online to open up a savings account for my son I did not know they don't do that for children younger than 18 anyways long story short the consultant who called me was extremely rude when I asked him why they don't open up accounts for children he literally put the phone down in my ear... What kind of person that does to me its like he just wanted to make a quick sale for commission instead of doing his bladdy job he has no manners whatsoever please get professional people to work in this kind of industry who are willing to help and explain to customers because you will end up loosing customers due to lack of respect and manners in your business!!!!! I will definitely be taking my business somewhere else where I'm treated with respect.. I will never invest my money in a company with people who lack respect for customers I'm highly disappointed and disgusted... ,1
"I had the unfortunate experience of being mugged on Tuesday 18th May 2021. My Discovery Credit card was taken and used. When I had the credit card, I always had to enter a pin before the transaction was approved. Apparently, Discovery activated the tap and go (massive security risk) and did not notify me. The rude consultant that I called told me that I will be responsible for the purchases because the card is a “Tap and Go” and the criminals had the card. I have now closed my credit card account and Discovery can keep the credit cards that criminals can control. Warning to the public, do not trust that Discovery have your best interests when you get a credit card, they have their best financial gain agenda.",1
"I would like to express my joy and gratitude at the awesome service I received from Kristin at Discovery Bank new accounts division. I had been trying to open a discovery bank account since October 2020 without success because I had fallen victim to identity theft fraud. I had been transferred to all the divisions at Discovery Bank and I had spoken to many different agents without a successful outcome. On the 11th of May 2021 I was blessed when I was put through to Kristin, she followed and investigated my matter from my first account application attempt while she asked me to hold. She asked me to forward to her the documents I had sent to fraud division. She promised to call me back, which unlike the other agents who promised to call back but never did, she called me back the very same day and she told me she had resolved my issue. Within 2 days my account was opened, today my card was delivered and activated. Kristin's work ethic and professionalism showed me what companies can achieve with the right staff who are fit for purpose and passionate about what they do. Kristin is a true professional and a real asset to Discovery Bank, thank you so so much, your service was the best I have ever received from Discovery Bank. You rock, keep it up Kristin! Your work ethic has taught me an important life lesson, that I must give my best at work and consistently deliver excellent service to my clients. Thank You!",5
"Disco Bank are very secretive about email contact for resolving FRAUD issues.They only make numbers available. Calling them internationally is super expensive and a waste of time and money. A 10 minute call costing over R300 and no resolution, got handed off twice, the third time the call went dead. ",1
"I have been trying to cancel that useless card for the past year ,I now see that I have a bill of over R1000 ,when you want to cancel they direct you to everywhere and you still can't cancel the stupid thing. The card accumulates fees even though I haven't used it in 2 years .",1
"I have had a card with Discovery since way before this bank came into existence. I am a ""loyal"" Discovery brand supporter: no longer. A bank card I have with them into which Discovery Life pays into that an annual premium for convenience. Yesterday I decided to start using the card and I went into my ccount and called their call centre. Numerous security questions were put to me and I answered with flying colours. I asked the agent who was extremely polite and intelligentthat my card was ready for use: I went last night to make payment at a grocer: it was declined. No explanation given by sms. Just ""declined"". I called and spoke to another agent this morning and she said the problem was the limit was incorrect and had to be set again which was duly done. I went to pay for medication that I needed. The card declined again. I was seriously feeling that Discovery Bank had a vendetta against me.....their own client.

Tonight I arrived home having faced humiliation in the pharmacy. The call centre agent lied to me and said that the pharmacy's bank machine broke signal. I then ;lost my temper and insisted that I get put through to a manager. Eventually after repetitive pack of lies the Manager Kingsley said there was a dormancy lock on my card. Yet the account was debited every month with a card fee and there was no hesitation in debiting the account with all apporporiate charges Discovery Bank saw fit to debit me with. So count on your purely    electronic banker to desert you debit you and to withold the truth from you! Once the dormancy is lifted goodby! Mr Adrian Gore and however else set up this bank......electronic banking is not the panacea for bad service......it has serious shortcomings.......including a call centre agent who will not or may not tell you the truth! I demand answers from Discovery Bank and demand they lift their hold onto money I am entitled to!",1
"Discovery Bank is by far the biggest scammers and fraudsters I've ever come across.  Not only is money stolen from me every month for a service I don't use but now Discovery Bank has decided to open a Vitality Savings Account in my name without my consent or approval.  This is Fraud and if this Savings account is not removed from my profile in a timely manner I will report Discovery Bank to the Ombudsman for Fraud and get a lawyer involved.  

The above reasons is why I stopped using my credit card and is in the process of paying it off, as soon as this is done I will close the account as I do not want to be associated with a company that commits fraud and steals from their clients.",1
Wish I could give them a zero. MONTHS have gone by with no resolution re suspended account. As far as the banking ombudsman is concerned an account cannot be suspended for a period exceeding 60 days. It's been 5 MONTHS. To no avail. I want the account closed as it is affecting my credit report. I am getting sent from pillar to post! ,1
"I have discovered more than twice that Discovery Bank has been fraudulently taling instalment from my Capitec account..this is still after I complained about it to say..Listen, I DON'T BANK WITH YOUR BANK so I don't know why I still have to reverse debut orders from thwm when I have nothing to do with them?it is stealing people's money what they are doing ",1
"I am appalled by the service received from Discovery bank ,I was scammed by their client and I reported the matter a guy by the name of Nishan from discovery fraud dept  called me to say there is money in their fraudsters account but sorry they cant refund me ,how is this fair practice ??when will crime end in SA if fraudsters know that there is no consequences to their actions???Discovery please just pay my money ,I need it I took a loan as I was desperately trying to secure vacant land for my parent who has nowhere to stay , by all means please stop this syndicate from prospering as you are protecting them .call me now on ********** and refund me ",3
"I opened an account with Discovery bank last year during theock down. I have never used the account, in fact the account has some hold on it as per the Consultant I spoke to however it has accumulated bank fees since last year. I cannot be expected to pay these fees as I don't understand where they come from and the account has a hold on it. How does an non existent non working account accumulate charges. I was promised a call back when I spoke to a Discovery Bank Consultant 2 months ago and I still haven't been called. This needs to be sorted out as it is day light robbery. How does a frozen account accumulat fees? ",1
"Good day

I'm so disappointed that the latest version of Discovery Bank App only works with face recognition. Is this restriction really necessary? Why can't I be allowed to use the app with fingerprint authentication as I was able to do so previously? 

I've had to uninstall my Discovery app as the camera on my phone is not working. This is definitely not dazzling me, the assumption that everyone has working camera phone is short sighted and dangerous.

"CHECK YOUR ACCOUNTS!! DISCOVERY COULD BE STEALING FROM YOU TOO!!

I recently discovered that DISCOVERY BANK has been incorrectly debiting money from my Standard bank account without my consent for +-5 years.

I first reported this to DISCOVERY BANK on Friday the 25/09/2020 after speaking to a consultant via customer service. I was asked to send the documented proof, which I did and didn't receive a response.

By 25/11/2020 (TWO MONTHS LATER) I still had no response and sent yet another email as the consultant requested with my phone number, ID number and name. Here is a copy of the email:

A few days later MARUSHA GOVENDER phones me and explains that the incorrect deduction is an admin mistake regarding an incorrect account number on another person's actual Discovery account.

By 25/01/2021 (TWO MONTHS LATER) DISCOVERY IS STILL DEDUCTING THE MONEY and still hasn't repaid my money.

Hi Meme, Constant von Berg here. We spoke yesterday regarding a mistaken debit order from discovery that has yet not been resolved or reimbursed. My first inquiry was on September 25 2020. My first successful response from Marusha Govender was on 08 December 2020. The message I sent to Murisha on 08 December is now missing for some reason and I only have the automatic response email in my inbox of the same date.

I will be making backups of our correspondence for further action as I have been as polite and patient as any reasonable person can be. Please help me sort this out. The total amount deducted as far back as 2017(that I can track) comes to roughly  The last deduction was 25 January, not February as I stated in our last conversation, my apologies.

Of course, I got no response or update after that.

I phoned again on 23/03/2021 and got to a consultant name MIHLALI NTONGA. I was asked to send the required documents AGAIN which I did. I was then assured the problem would be sorted out.

It is today 26/03/2021 - 6 MONTHS SINCE MY FIRST INQUIRY AND STILL NO SOLUTION. I am now involving the public, the press and eventually the legal system.

ADDENDUM 1: It is today 05/04/2021. A week and a half later since my last review and 6 MONTHS AND 10 DAYS since the initial inquiry. Not so much as an email or a phone call with and update. The OBSSA will now be notified since Discovery Bank is clearly not intent on paying back the money.

ADDENDUM 2: It is today 26/04/2021. 20 Days have past since my last review and assurances by Discovery that they will fix their mistake and pay back my money. Of course, as we should know by now, this has not happened. Last week the 19/20 of April, I phoned once again to hear if there are any updates since the matter has apparently been ""escalated"" to higher levels since MARCH already. This is of course after I was assured MY MONEY to the tune of R18000,00 which Discovery has essentially stolen would be paid back in JANUARY of 2021 at which time the matter was already supposedly ""escalated"" to the appropriate authorities.

In short it has been 7 MONTHS since I first reported the matter to Discovery. 3 MONTHS since MARUSHA GOVENDER ""escalated"" the matter and I was assured my money would be paid back (which never happened) and 1 MONTH after MHLALI NTONGA ""escalated"" the matter AGAIN with zero results. One has to wonder if this bank thinks this sort of blatant negligence which amounts to the criminal is some sort of joke?

ADDENDUM 3: Phoned Discovery again on 04/05/2021. Got hold of DIVHANI THOVHOGI who was as helpful as she could be. She was unable to put me through to MIHLALI NTONGA who is supposed to be handling the case and requested a call back from him. As expected, he did not call back. 

I phoned again on 05/05/2021 and got hold of AOBAKWE NALELEME who was as helpful as she could be. She was unable to put me through to MIHLALI NTONGA or provide any contact details and requested yet another call back from him. As expected, he did not call back. Discovery were also unwilling or unable to provide any contact details for their legal department.",1
"For 3 months I have been trying to cancel a credit card that I have not used for years. I I got this card to activate the vitality benefit for apple watch, via FNB, this was even before Discovery bank came into being. Once the contract was up (24months) I never used this facility since, dont even know where that card is......This bank refuses to cancel the credit card and keeps on attempting to debit my account with monthly fees. This is highly unethical and to think that I was considering switching banks from FNB to them, good thing I never did. Next I need to also cancel the Vitality scam. I'm done with Discovery, cant do business with unethical people",1
"Hi
I have been trying to cancel my discovery credit card since February/March. They seem to do everything in their power to make it an impossible task. This surely must conflict with regulations. The general call centre tells me there is no email address or phone number I can contact, but instead they will call me back to facilitate - this of course never happens. R95 a month for a service I never use. I even tried cancelling on the app, yet I am still being charged monthly. This must conflict with some regulation.  I only had the card because of the Apple Watch benefit which expired in February.

"Firstly, I use/have used online banking for FNB, Investec, Nedbank, CAPITEC, African Bank and Discovery - which is the worst banking site, can’t even compare to any of the others.

(2) And when I want to open a SAVINGS account I must enter info like where do I obtain my income from, and what am I earning. THAT IS ABSOLUTELY NONE OF YOUR BUSINESS. I KNOW what account I want, ASK me if I need help, don’t force me to disclose information you don’t need. And the info I filled in is nonsense anyway, so it does not help you with your data gathering. (3) I have called the Discovery bank number many many times, have never been able to speak to a human being, after holding on for over 10 minutes. And they call back at 8pm. Really, I don’t want to speak to my bank at 8pm! And on a number of occasions I entered my ID (why do you want my ID before I’m even a customer) and that’s where it ends, the call cuts off.",1

"Interest chargers are ridiculous if you owe 10000.01 and pay 10000 then you will pay interest on 0.01+ whatever you spend until your next statement period, hence the charge ""on both the statement balance (which is the unsettled amount) and on any new purchases made on the card"" 

Why pay interest on your current spend that is not overdue.",1
"Applied for credit increase, no feedback I had to keep following up. I earn well, I have paid all my bills on time, over pay my card. Was declined due to a micro loan I took due to a life threatening family emergency and using all my credit (which is minimal) at Woolworths due to same family emergency. Very very disappointed in the company I used to work for! You realise we are people, not algorithms? I was so impressed initially, now just quite disgusted. Was told you’re a “behavioural bank”! Perhaps you should consider your own “behaviour” and treat clients like people not numbers! ",1
"Had the unpleasant experience of trying to get help from Discovery Bank for an application of a new credit card. Firstly, can I just spare everyone some time  - go somewhere else! much easier...
Anyway, trying to help my elderly mother to get this application completed online, already here Discovery misses the mark by a long shot! very complex confusing process with vague (if not useless) guidelines. Nevertheless, we managed to get a application submitted (after about 4hours), only to have it ""declined"" due to invalid documents - now, for those who tried this, many congratulations for figuring out *** they want.. and trying to change/resubmit is an even more *****ed up. Let me just say, all the documents were provided in the first place! it looks like they are just not linked to the document set, which belongs in a documents group, which contains specific documents... ***...
tried calling the call center for help and omw - i'd rather run head first into a wall!!
So here we are! wishing someone more clued up can actually open their eyes, look at the documents and process the damn application - or just tell us to go away!

"I would like to warn everyone to check the terms and conditions very carefully before using the iphone benefit. It is advertised as ""how to get an iphone for free"", the four simple steps listed are :-
1    Activate Vitality Active Rewards on the latest Discovery app.
2   Browse the iPhones you may qualify for on the Discovery Bank app.
3    Visit iStore to select your iPhone and complete your iPhone activation.
4    Achieve your. Vitality Active Rewards goals over 24 months.

Which leads you to believe that if you achieve all your goals for 24 months that the phone will be free.

This is not the case unless you choose an iphone whose budget instalment is less to or equal to your maximum benefit amount.

The Discovery App gives you the maximum amount that you can spend on your phone, but this well exceeds the amount that you can spend on a phone and then get it for free.

I have just had a lengthy chat with Discovery Bank and basically even if I attain all my goals for the next 24 months I will be charged R6000 in interest charges.

There is nothing that I can do to prevent this - I wanted to pay the capital balance, but if I do that apparently this will cancel the benefit and I won't get any cash back. 

Also you cannot repay just the capital balance you have to settle the full amount including two years of interest.

Discovery's core values are :-
    Innovation and optimism.
    Business astuteness and prudence.
    Great people.
    Liberating the best in our people.
    Integrity, honesty and fairness.
    Intellectual leadership.
    Tenacity, urgency and drive.
    Dazzle clients.
I am definitely not Dazzled and I don't believe that this shows a high level of integrity. ",1
"I am extremely frustrated with the service I have received (or NOT received) from Discovery Bank. I have been a secondary card holder on Discovery for many years and since the Vitality rules changed in Feb 2021 I no longer get my gym booster cash bank benefit. So at the beginning of March I decided to open my own discovery credit card account so that I would be eligible for the cash back. Fast forward two months and I still haven't been able to open an account. I have called the call centre multiple times (various service agents have promised to assist me, promised to call back, promised to resolve it as a matter of urgency). I have sent multiple emails to discovery and I only ever get an automated response promising that this will be addressed. 
To add to my frustration, I get daily sms's and emails from Discovery telling me that my account is ""just a few clicks away"". It's not a few clicks away. Your mobile app is the worst. I'm sure by the time this is resolved you'll have changed your rules again and I won't be eligible for gym booster cash back anyway.  :(",1

Hi Meme, Constant von Berg here. We spoke yesterday regarding a mistaken debit order from discovery that has yet not been resolved or reimbursed. My first inquiry was on September 25 2020. My first successful response from Marusha Govender was on 08 December 2020. The message I sent to Murisha on 08 December is now missing for some reason and I only have the automatic response email in my inbox of the same date. After having no response or interaction, I then forwarded the email to Lulu on 03 February. Here is a copy/paste of previous messages with required documents attached. I will be making backups of our correspondence for further action as I have been as polite and patient as any reasonable person can be. Please help me sort this out.

Of course, I got no response or update after that.

I phoned again on 23/03/2021 and got to a consultant name MIHLALI NTONGA. I was asked to send the required documents AGAIN which I did. I was then assured the problem would be sorted out.

It is today 26/03/2021 - 6 MONTHS SINCE MY FIRST INQUIRY AND STILL NO SOLUTION. I am now involving the public, the press and eventually the legal system.

ADDENDUM 1: It is today 05/04/2021. A week and a half later since my last review and 6 MONTHS AND 10 DAYS since the initial inquiry. Not so much as an email or a phone call with and update. The OBSSA will now be notified since Discovery Bank is clearly not intent on paying back the money.

ADDENDUM 2: It is today 26/04/2021. 20 Days have past since my last review and assurances by Discovery that they will fix their mistake and pay back my money. Of course, as we should know by now, this has not happened. Last week the 19/20 of April, I phoned once again to hear if there are any updates since the matter has apparently been ""escalated"" to higher levels since MARCH already. This is of course after I was assured MY MONEY to the tune of R18000,00 which Discovery has essentially stolen would be paid back in JANUARY of 2021 at which time the matter was already supposedly ""escalated"" to the appropriate authorities.

In short it has been 7 MONTHS since I first reported the matter to Discovery. 3 MONTHS since MARUSHA GOVENDER ""escalated"" the matter and I was assured my money would be paid back (which never happened) and 1 MONTH after MHLALI NTONGA ""escalated"" the matter AGAIN with zero results. One has to wonder if this bank thinks this sort of blatant negligence which amounts to the criminal is some sort of joke?

ADDENDUM 3: Phoned Discovery again on 04/05/2021. Got hold of DIVHANI THOVHOGI who was as helpful as she could be. She was unable to put me through to MIHLALI NTONGA who is supposed to be handling the case and requested a call back from him. As expected, he did not call back. 

I phoned again on 05/05/2021 and got hold of AOBAKWE NALELEME who was as helpful as she could be. She was unable to put me through to MIHLALI NTONGA or provide any contact details and requested yet another call back from him. As expected, he did not call back. Discovery were also unwilling or unable to provide any contact details for their legal department.

"I have been unable to use Discovery Miles to pay for goods in-store for weeks now.  I reported the issue 2 weeks ago, and I sent in screenshots to ***********.  Apart from an automated response, I have heard nothing more from them, except one voice message by an agent who wanted to know what the issue was.  I have subsequently called back twice, and each time I get another story.

Today I was told that this was an ongoing issue.  If so, why hasn't the Bank contacted their clients to inform them of the issue?  Why do I have to follow up?  Why do they not respond to e-mails?  Why do they not call back their clients experiencing ongoing issues?

I am disgusted at the terrible service (or lack thereof).",1
"I am a secondary account holder on my husband's Discovery credit card. My credit card expired at the end of March. He applied for a new one on Discovery Bank. We were told that the only way to get it was for me to onto the Discovery Bank app and organise delivery through that app. But when I went onto that app it wanted to register me as a new client and there was no option for me to  organise delivery of the card. After 2 phone calls to Discovery Bank, which amounted to being told to delete the app and wait a few days and then install it again, I managed to get a message saying there was an outstanding action, and that finally allowed me to organise delivery. That process took a few hours. So now I have the card. Two things have to happen. My husband has to authorise the card to activate it which he did. Now I have to activate my card by opening the app. But when I open the app, it sees me as a new user and the only option I am given is to tell the app my current monthly income and order a new card. I don't want a new card, as I have the un-activated card from my husband. And I have a Discovery Card in my own name. But this ridiculous app does not offer any option other than to tell them my salary and order a new card. Meantime a month has passed and I have not had my card, and now I have it I can't activate it. Can Discovery Bank explain why it has this absolutely pathetic app. Why can't it find a more streamlined and efficient way for a card to be activated? I have spent another few hours on this and still can't use the card. This is very frustrating as I use this card for all business purchases. For one month I have not been able to make any. ",1

"I have applied multiple times to get a credit card so I can purchase the Apple Watch so I can increase my vitality status. As the credit card is the only way to get the apply watch. This is 1stly a very one sided opperation. Secondly my affordability to get a measly R20k credit limit is to much for discovery bank to give even though I have a credit limit of over R250k with FNB and my expendable income is more than double compared to the credit I am applying for.

Discovery bank is a bank that doesn’t want to help their clients or future clients. They are absolutely useless and not a bank at all in my eyes.

If you want t deal with a real bank then go to FNB. They make banking easy and possible.

Discovery bank is a joke and they are a “play play” bank as far as I am concerned.

I’m extremely unsatisfied with Discovery Bank because since March I have been trying to order a new card and nobody that I speak to at the call Center can assist me.

"I have been a Discovery client since year 2000 and have used their Discovery Credit Card for more than 10 years quite happily ... until it all became ""Discovery Bank""!

Since May 2020 I have not been able to use my card overseas, since there is no roaming on my SA mobile phone number and Discovery Bank doesn't have an option to sent OTPs via email - something Discovery did for many year without issues. So in May 2020 I was left without a properly working credit card while overseas. At the same time they removed email support completely (something Discovery used to have), I could no longer email them and if I call their phone number it asks me for an OTP, which I cannot get because of no roaming. Clever!

My card has now expired. I called them to ask if they have a solution to the OTP issue and also if they can issue a new plastic to replace the expired one. On the call they told me ""no problem, somebody will call you in the next few days to change your OTP phone number to your overseas number"", of course this never happened. Two more calls over the following weeks (two hours+ spent on international phone calls) and two more times they promise they will call me back as they couldn't do anything over the phone as their system ""didn't allow them to do anything"" or some other BS. Anyway, nobody has called, no email support, to get through to them it is like 10 minutes jumping through hoops through their useless IVR. 

Bottom line, Discovery Bank is a ""bank"" , which is incapable of renewing an expired credit card and is incapable of providing a working card for anybody who is overseas without roaming or not have access to their SA mobile phone for whatever reason. They do NOT ever keep their promises to call you back and they generally could not care less about providing any remotely acceptable service. 

They even had the audacity to charge me the monthly fee on my account without being able to provide ANY SERVICE TO ME WHATSOEVER!!! I do not have a working / non-expired card with them as they could not renew it because I don't have roaming and even if I did have a non-expired plastic, I could not use it as I can't get OTPs delivered to international number or to email.

Dear Discovery Bank, you are a TOTAL FAILURE, you should close down and leave banking to people that know what they are doing!!! You have failed to provide the MOST BASIC banking service, such as reissue a credit card and have a reasonable solution for people without access to their SA mobile phones! All of this was working 100% pre-Discovery Bank!!!

I have my credit card with them, transactional, and savings. I'll never use another bank again. From handling general queries to emergency withdrawal requests and more, this bank has gone above and beyond what I'd expect.

I really hope they never change. I can happily recommend them to anyone and I often do.",5
"So, it turns out Discovery Bank (DB) is every bit as poor as all the bad press they get on social media - I am now experiencing it first-hand. For months I resisted their enticements to switch over until I was forced to a few weeks ago.

Where to start? Let me start here. A few months ago, after DB migrated the old Discovery Cards onto their own platform I noticed that they had swopped the primary and secondary cardholders, being my wife and I. I called them, and asked them to rectify this, which they said they would, and I thought nothing further of it. How they managed to mess this up nobody knows. Of course they didn't in fact rectify this, and it has now come back to bite me.

Fast forward a few months. My wife misplaced her purse, so I made use of the handy 'Pause' function via the DB website. When we couldn't find the card, we decided to cancel the card, which to my knowledge is common parlance for when you have lost a bank card. So I went onto the DB website again, and clicked on 'Cancel', in my haste not noticing that there was also a 'Replace' option. This was a grave mistake of mine. Even the most basic user-experience principles would require a confirmation step from the user at this point, as cancelling actually means completely cancelling the cardholder from the account. Turns out on the DB app there is exactly such a confirmation step, which also explains what you are about to do and suggests that perhaps you were actually intending to replace, not cancel. But on the DB website, you click the 'Cancel' button, and that's it.

Since I needed a new card for my wife I decided to rather call in. At this point I was told that as I had cancelled the card, it could not be replaced via the Call Center, and I had to now join DB and request a new card via the app. I was not happy to be forced to switch to DB, so I asked for a supervisor to call me. A supervisor then did call me, and apologised, but explained that there was no other way. So, I reluctantly went through the process of 'Join the Bank' via the app, and the supervisor talked me through the steps to request a new card for my wife. All seemed ok, except that she was surprised I hadn't been asked to confirm the delivery address. Nevertheless, even though the requested new card did not show in the 'Cards' section on the app, the supervisor was confident everything was ok, and that it would probably update overnight. To be sure, she offered to check the next day, and call me back. Needless to say, I'm still waiting for that call.

Having not received any call, and still not seeing my wife's replacement card on the app, I tried to request a new card again. I got an error, saying that there was already a request in process. So I called in to the Call Center. Ayanda answered the call, and even though I asked her to check on her system who the supervisor was who had dealt with me and to ask her to call me, Ayanda offered that she was sure she could help me. She was friendly and seemed knowledgeable, and she determined that my wife now also needed to download the app and 'Join the Bank' to complete the reuest. So, we went through that laborious process, but when Ayanda checked on her side, the reason we still couldn't complete the replacement request was because the system was looking for a primary card and couldn't find it. But my card was on the system! Ayanda said she would check with her backend team and get back to me. Later that day she called me back, and explained that the problem was that my wife was now the primary cardholder, and not me (remember, the DB migration stuff-up!). She said we'd have to cancel everything and start again. At this point I lost it. Poor Ayanda copped all the flack for DB's ineptitude. She calmly listened to my tirade, to her credit. I said there was no way I would go through that whole process again, and that she must get a supervisor or manager to call me and that DB must sort out their mess through the back-end. Well, that was on Wed. It' now Fri, and I am still waiting.",1

Hi Meme, Constant von Berg here. We spoke yesterday regarding a mistaken debit order from discovery that has yet not been resolved or reimbursed. My first inquiry was on September 25 2020. My first successful response from Marusha Govender was on 08 December 2020. The message I sent to Murisha on 08 December is now missing for some reason and I only have the automatic response email in my inbox of the same date. After having no response or interaction, I then forwarded the email to Lulu on 03 February. Here is a copy/paste of previous messages with required documents attached. I will be making backups of our correspondence for further action as I have been as polite and patient as any reasonable person can be. Please help me sort this out. The total amount deducted as far back as 2017(that I can track) comes to roughly  The last deduction was 25 January, not February as I stated in our last conversation, my apologies.

For your convenience, I have highlighted the deductions in the pdf bank statements and made a short summary of deductions with dates and amounts in a txt file.

My phone number is *********. Please phone me so that I know the message was received in good order.

Regards

C. von Berg

Hello Lulu

Here is a copy/paste quote of my message to Marusha Govender. I also attach my bank statements available to me. The date of the original message is 08 Dec 2020. I did also forward the original conversation again to clientdocuments, but I can't update the subject line.

Please reply via email or a quick phone call so that I know the email was received in good order.

Good day Marusha

We spoke on the phone regarding an incorrect deduction from discovery.

I have attached all the statements I have at my disposal, although I'm beginning to think the deductions go further back than April 2017. I have also attached a screenshot of my standard bank app showing a recent deduction with the name ""DISCBANK DISCBANK **********9"" that is called ""DISCOV"" in earlier transactions.

My phone number is ******. My ID number is ******. My full name is Constant von Berg.

Regards

C. Von Berg

Of course, I got no response or update after that.

I phoned again on 23/03/2021 and got to a consultant name MIHLALI NTONGA. I was asked to send the required documents AGAIN which I did. I was then assured the problem would be sorted out.

It is today 26/03/2021 - 6 MONTHS SINCE MY FIRST INQUIRY AND STILL NO SOLUTION. I am now involving the public, the press and eventually the legal system.

ADDENDUM 1: It is today 05/04/2021. A week and a half later since my last review and 6 MONTHS AND 10 DAYS since the initial inquiry. Not so much as an email or a phone call with and update. The OBSSA will now be notified since Discovery Bank is clearly not intent on paying back the money.

ADDENDUM 2: It is today 26/04/2021. 20 Days have past since my last review and assurances by Discovery that they will fix their mistake and pay back my money. Of course, as we should know by now, this has not happened. Last week the 19/20 of April, I phoned once again to hear if there are any updates since the matter has apparently been ""escalated"" to higher levels since MARCH already. This is of course after I was assured MY MONEY to the tune of R18000,00 which Discovery has essentially stolen would be paid back in JANUARY of 2021 at which time the matter was already supposedly ""escalated"" to the appropriate authorities.

In short it has been 7 MONTHS since I first reported the matter to Discovery. 3 MONTHS since MARUSHA GOVENDER ""escalated"" the matter and I was assured my money would be paid back (which never happened) and 1 MONTH after MHLALI NTONGA ""escalated"" the matter AGAIN with zero results. One has to wonder if this bank thinks this sort of blatant negligence which amounts to the criminal is some sort of joke?

"Having been a discovery member and employee years back, I often pride myself of the service from Discovery as a whole. And as such I always makes sure that everywhere I go, my superiors always signup on one of Discovery's products.

You can imagine the disbelief I am having now at the service level I am getting from Discovery Bank. I have been battling to finalize my boss's application for a while now. Much as I understand the security checks involved in order to protect the client, it still does not warrant the lack of promptness and competency I am experiencing. 

Much as Mr Adrian Gore cannot be expected to be a very long call with a consultant, My boss also cannot, hence I handle everything, but that has been a nightmare. I have key in the required OTP(always having to call m boss the get the number), I have emailed credit as directed, but up until this day, we are still awaiting feedback from Discovery. By mentioning the consultants, I hope it wont affect their incentives, because they are just following the ""script"".

But when I need to speak to a senior person, I am expecting to be transferred to someone who will be in a position to try and assist and follow up until the query is resolved, but unfortunately that is not the case with Discovery Bank.
The ones I could remember is Kea(?) , Thandiwe Gama, who told me Muzi Ndlovu is not listed anywhere on Discovery directory. The last person I spoke with is Kgalalelo Ratlhogo, who assured me that the matter will be resolved.

I am honestly only following up just to save face infront of my boss, other than that, I am appalled at the service level I have received. Having been on the other side of the line myself before, I would resort to Hellopeter, but I have been lef with no choice at all.

Remain blessed",1
"Logged a query september last year for my vitality money to be sorted. i phoned this morning again and the lady that i spoke to just cancelled the call. This is so frustrating to deal with a bank that doesnt have your best interest at heart. The latest reference number i have for this query is **********. They also never come back to you, YOU have to get back to them if you logged a query. Frustration beyond frustration.",1
"I have been trying to update my email address with discovery bank for over a week. 
I called in today and asked for my work address to be updated as my balances and notifications get sent to this address, i was told i have wait 3 days! this is total nonsense nobody wants to help and as of today my emails get forwarded to someone else! the worse service ever!  ",1
I have been struggling with Discovery bank for 2 months just to renew my expired credit card. I have phoned numerous times and everytime they have a different excuse. This is not rocket science. It is by far the worst service from any bank. ,1
"I am so frustrated with Discovery.  There is a statement missing from the download section in my App, which I now urgently need for tax purposes.  2 Weeks of phone calls, emails, HelloPeter reviews and NADA.  Nothing from Discovery...",1
"The cancellation of my banking suite has been delayed for the past year - first I was told there functionality to cancel was not available & the fees would be reversed. Instead I have had to make payments towards them. I have been trying to close this account to no avail. I keep calling & I am promised someone will call me back with the confirmation & no one does. Instead the fees keep accumulating. In March 2021 when I called in to follow-up on my request I was told I was owing & I settled. And today April 22, I am told I owe R500. Yet I don't use these account. What are the charges for??????????????

I am not happy with the service. Please close this account because I am now not accountable to the fees that have accumulated. I was assured that once I settled the balance it would be closed. The balance was at 0 now its R500.",1
"Very poor service.

I joined discovery around 2 months ago. Firstly i received very bad service to just get my account going. I even considered going back to my old bank but decided to stick with them as i have had good experiences with other discovery products 
.i also got an iphone through them shortly after. After my first “goal cycle” i had met 50% of my goals hence i owed 50%. I paid the outstanding amount into my credit card but under “credit facility” the screen didnt update and it still said i haven’t made the payment. As i didnt wanna be in arrears i thought i had to make a payment to my budget account (which wasn’t my intention). So i made a r5k transfer in there thinking that it would be reversible. I even called the call centre on the 6th i think and the agent also didnt know why the screen didnt updated and even suggested that i try paying into the budget account.  Today i realised that making the r5k payment resulted in a decreased instalment (hence decreased cash back). However this is not explained anywhere. I called discovery today as my transfer was clearly a mistake and the call centre lady mentioned that they wouldn’t be able to reverse this transaction????! I mean this was clearly a mistake and i just need it reversed., i had no intention to put r5k towards my budget payment just now as it makes no sense for me to reduce my cash back! The lady ensured me that she would escalate the matter but i know from past experience with discovery bank that i will probably never hear from then. Hence here i am!
Please assist me in reversing this transaction.As the lady i spoke to mentioned the system isn’t built thinking that people would make mistakes so it can’t be reversed. However I’m sure manual adjustments can be made!  But if that’s not the case  the Implications of paying into the iphone budget account should be made clear. Kindly escalate accordingly and assist in reversing this transaction.

"I have been relentlessly trying to cancel my Discovery Bank since 2018. I have sent emails and called them directly over a dozen times. Each time I am assured that the charges made from 2018 will be reversed and that my account will be closed. Alas, it is 2021 and my account is still open and I am receiving messages from Discovery that legal action will be taken against me for not paying my bank fees. Since there is no physical bank, I am reaching out to Discovery on this platform, to please rectify this issue. It becomes impossible to believe in your service when you are not capable of executing a simple task. ",1
"I have been trying to get a credit card from you and have been pushed from pillar to post. You wnt me to bank with you but you won't even offer me what I have currently elsewhere and other banks will give me. Your online application system is up to maggets and the whole experience has been terrible. See as I no longer need to be on your medical aid I will be taking that elsewhere as I am being held to ransom to get the discounts I use to get by just being on Vitality, I now have to pay more to join your bank to still get those and then you still want me to be happy with your shocking service. If you are going to get someone to call me don't bother unless it is a manager with the power to make proper decisions not your Call Centre people who cannot do anything.",1
"Discovery offer a discount on miles-based purchases of 5% per service that you subscribe to. Despite having and active discovery insure account, this is not reflected on my app (although my points are reflected on a weekly basis and rewards therefore are issued). My discounts are therefore 5% less than they should be. I reported this to Discovery Bank initially on 8 Feb 2021. It has been 'escalated' on numerous occasions. Apparently Discovery Bank is waiting for feedback from Discovery Insure. I am a Discovery fan and give credit for the many things they are doing well...but to leave you customer with out a resolution for 10 week and no evidence that there is progress, is worth a complant.
I'm resorting to Hello Peter because the official channels are not producing results.",1
"I had an amazing experience joining the bank today. I spoke with Anver Williams and he was extremely friendly, understanding and actually humane. We had a conversation and it didn't feel like he was reading a script to me and didn't ask me unnecessary questions, to confirm information he already had. If joining a bank was done with Anver, or for that matter, joining anything, I'd do it twice. I would highly recommend speaking and dealing with him when joining Discovery Bank.",5
"Would give them no stars if i could. I applied with them for a credit facility. They blundly told me i do not qualify. Wonder if my skin colour had anything to do with it. I then applied at a few other places and shockingly to my suprise they were ALL very willing to assist me and i got not only the credit card i wanted, but they also offerred me a loan. These guys are crooks just like with their medical aid and life insurance. I have heard and myself experienced shocking lack of service. And just for those who does not know this yet, they have a very selective customer base. Please dont even get involved with them they are worse than loan sharks. They a prime example of a company existing within a gangster state our poor country has become. Just stay away you much better off.",1
"Leaving this here for visibility, due to Discovery's most pathetic attempt at a banking system and messing me around for over a month I now dislike the brand so much I will be shopping for a new Medical aid.  Please let your execs know that your bank is driving away clients from the brand entirely.",1
"My current wife gets phone calls from discovery bank 2 to 3 times a day asking us for payment. this account was opened with my previous wife about 20 years ago. this account has been paid, we asked for a statement in November 2020, which my ex-wife paid, she sent confirmation to me and I sent it to Discovery Bank, Larry Williamson, who heads one of the collections departments, told me he sees the account has been paid but cant find it???? (what ever that means) he has spoken to my ex-wife, who has sent him everything that she has the power to get. but nothing has happened. the bank still has some company calling us everyday about this account, when I try to contact Larry, we spent hours on the phone going from one person to the next, eventually the phone call is cut off, I'm trying to have this sorted out so we do not have people wasting our time while at work asking us for money that we have already paid. No joy from Discovery Bank would not recommend them to anyone.",1
"Dear Discovery,

I recently upgraded my bank account, DSV Has been trying to contact me to arrange delivery of my new card but due to complications my phone is not accessible.

Service is poor.Iv ask them to explain to me y I swipe the card today and the money taken after 1 week and every time I withdraw money is still shows two amounts.Ill just have to cancel this card...is a stress,1
There is a statement missing from my download section which I need for tax purposes.  Five phone calls (the last one being put on hold for more than an hour) and still no statement.  Shocking!,1
Discovery Bank’s service is Super Poor - Asked for Feedback and Review of a Credit Card Application. Still waiting for someone that can make decisions to phone me back? I’ve been one of their clients for two years - never been treated so poorly by a Bank.,1
"Thami, the relationship manager at Discovery called me the next day after I posted about my experience with them. He clarified everything and noted points were the consultant and the manager who signed me up for the policy, have gone wrong in explaining the policy. He stated that client feedback is taken seriously and will be addressed with the sales department to mitigate future occurance ",4
"Where must I start: 

1.	More than 20 years ago, my entire family (4 members) joined Discovery as members of one or more of DISCOVERY’s products. PLEASE TAKE NOTE: “MORE THEN 20 YEARS AGO”

2.	This year 2021, our total monthly payment for DISCOVERY medical aid for all 4 members of this family exceeds R ** *** (5digits) per MONTH.

3.	The above mentioned does not even include the life insurances that I have with Discovery.

4.	I am debt free, never had bad debt, no criminal record, no vehicle or home loans, 40 years of accident-free driving, SA citizen. In short, I keep my nose CLEAN and my money management is very conservative. I know when to make use of credit and when not to use it.






Today I applied for a CREDIT CARD from Discovery, just to make some comparisons and because I can. After 20 minutes of questions, I was told “Sorry Sir your Credit Card application was declined, but we can offer you a savings account for the LOWER INCOME people, with a monthly fee of R 10. NO OVERDRAFT

Cheslyn was friendly and helpful. Staff is also very friendly and welcoming,4
"I have thousands of rands in Discovery Miles I have accumulated over the past few years from spending on my card which I have used periodically to pay in store. 3 weeks ago, out of the blue, that stopped working with a ""Technical Error 604""

I have since been told that I can only use them in the Active Rewards Mall on the app because I have not transferred to Discovery Bank.

But this doesn't work!

That page says you can only spend miles earned from Active Rewards and won't let me spend them! Based on the misery Discovery has put me through over the last few years I am not that excited about having to change to Discovery Bank. Maybe time for a change.

Seriously Discovery, what is up?",1
"I have been with discovery bank since the inception. I was assuming that Discovery has a great medical aid service the  bank will live up to the same level.

On the the 2nd of April Discovery Bank stole R455 money that I needed to make it through the month this is apparently an annual payment for Discovery banking services. In the 3 years I have been with Discovery bank this is the first time they taken this money.

Now to cancel my account appears to be impossible. I have no choice but to drive to Discovery offices and hopefully they will be able to assist.",1
"Telephone options do not cater for questions. Too many telephone options. Takes too long for anyone to answer the call (sometimes over 7 minutes).
Too many benefits on top of benefits which result in teh entire offer being too confusing. 
By the time I actually managed to talk to someone, I was angry to say the least.
The so-called ""service"" is BS. ",1
A deposit was made from Discovery Bank to my personal Nedbank account on the 6th April. POP sent. The money has still not reflected into my account. The staff at Discovery Bank are unhelpful and inefficient. They are not concerned in the least. The account holder has even followed up just to be brushed off. Discovery is holding onto the money and earning interest. I am not the only person effected by them holding onto payments. I find this poor banking practice. ,1
"Discovery bank is a joke, if been trying 3 months to update my number and email adress used this account 2 years ago didnt want to use it because of bad service. Same thing now cant even get my money. Dont have a office i can drive to to sort this out. Would not recommend any service from discovery bank",1
"Discovery Bank thinks we can read their minds. They bombard me with SMS's and Emails saying I still need to send them the additional documents. No more info, nada. I have sent it more than once and received a reply that agnollage the receipt of the documents but the SMS's en email does not stop.
It turned out I sent the wrong month's bank statement. but They don't bother telling you what is wrong just spam you to send the wrong additional documents again.
This is seriously terrible communication from Discovery!

They do the same with Discovery Insure. If you have 2 cars and each car have a tracker in but the one is faulty, they will just tell you you need to repair the tracker, but not specify which tracker.
They will send the message over and over but not give you what you need to do something about it. Not even a reference number or phone number ",1
I have been trying to close by account from November 2020. 5 months later nothing has been done. in the mean time card charges has been going against this account. I am now getting threatening SMS's and emails where I will be handed over to legal. I have continuously contacted discovery bank who has been promising to resolve this issue. STILL NO SUCCESS. ,1
"It’s a concern that Discovery Bank allows payments to be initiated to contacts who are not active on Discovery Pay. Normal banking practice is that a payment is rejected immediately should account numbers be incorrect. The recovery of the payment is not a simple process and the “normal” eft rejection process must be followed. No explanation about “normal” is available. My guess is that these funds reside within the Discovery banking environment, unallocated, until reimbursed to their client. My fault for not noticing the icon next to the contact details , but this payment should not have been processed by Discovery.",2
"A VERY frustrated customer trying to open a bank account for the past 3 months. I have 20 reference numbers with NOBODY coming back to me. Apparently an IT problem with the app but nobody in the call center knows what to do and keeps “escalating” the matter with NO RESULTS!!!! They are about to lose a young doctor as a customer forever for the most pathetic service I have ever encountered. I will probably move my insurance, medical aid and life cover else where! Where in this lifetime does it take 3+ months to open an account? ",1
I'm a bit ...sad. so Discovery Bank took over as Financial institution on the Disc Credit card from FNB. Their own bank ! Awesome hey! Until you pay the old account instead of the newly created account. Sorry beneficiary difficult for me to delete from Capitec Profile. So I paid the wrong account Tuesday. By Thursday realised. Friday holiday. Saturday I report. The agent send me email to ensure follow up. I send proof of payment and proof of my account by Saturday. Monday holiday. Tuesday nothing...Wednesday...Thursday I phone again. When? Surely 3 working days enough for transfer? No says agent. 10 working days. UNREAL for transfer with proof?? Ok so today 10 workdays as per her calculation. 16:25 Monday today. 13 april. No news. Ughh. ,3
"Discovery Bank’s Credit Application Process SUCKS! I was just turned down for a Credit Card without any Explanation via a SMS? No personal contact whatsoever! I then phoned and after holding for 25 Minutes and talking to no less than 3 “bankers” I was told that I could not prove affordability. 

I am a successful business owner and they made this decision on 3 months bank statements. I wanted to move my whole banking profile from Nedbank, but I am now totally disgusted and disappointed with this lack of professionalism. I would not encourage anyone anyone to move to Discovery Bank any time soon!",1
A week after promising feedback before end of business and guess what still nothing.  As per my promise I will continue to write my reviews here in the hope that it deters potential clients.  Stay away from Discovery Bank.  I am now contemplating canceling my medical aid with this company as a result of this.,1
"I have requested Discovery Bank to cancel my credit card on numerous occasions but still they send a statement showing Miles fee and other charges,  Their lady says she will cancel it immediately but does not.  My last HelloPeter review was not answered satisfactorily, I just get calls to FICA my account which I never asked for in the first place.  I did not request Discovery to obtain my details and open the account.  It was managed by FNB and all was fine.  As soon as Discovery without any permission from me took over the card is useless and I want it cancelled immediately.  I have an alternate credit card which is being administered well with which I am pleased.  I do not even think Discovery deserves a rating of 1 start I think there should be an option for a negative rating.",1
"A year ago I was retrenched and made a payment arrangement with discovery bank, which I have honored every month. 
For some reason I was still handed over to MBD attorneys who is calling me up to 7 times a day. It is reaching a point of harassment! It’s 9 o’clock in the morning and I’m on my third call. My parents are being harassed by MBD for 8years for a bill thats not even theirs! 
I REFUSE to deal with MBD if you have a problem with my payments or the arrangement I have with discovery bank please contact me yourself! 
And I would appreciate it if you would remove my name and details from their data base I don’t care how you do it just get it done! ",1
"I had the misfortune of having to renew my credit card just as Discovery Bank launched its own banking suite. Through the FNB app, my card management used to be a breeze. I contacted Discovery for a card renewal but SEVERAL new current account cards arrived via courier with a letter stating that the requests for Gold Credit Cards were so high that they were sending a temporary current account card, but that the Gold Credit Card would follow. I contacted them again after a month, I receive more temporary cards. After 3 months I finally got a Gold Credit Card.
I noticed on my Discovery Bank statements that these ‘replacement’ cards were all being charged as ‘additional’ cards. I never activated any of them at an ATM or on the Discovery app because I only wanted the Gold Credit Card. So I called on 26.02.2021 and spoke to a consultant and after explaining the sequence of events promises to phone back. She never calls back. I phone again on 01.03.2021 and this consultant tells me she never went on leave during lock-down and knew nothing about any replacement cards issued in lieu of the Gold Credit Card but promises to follow up with a phone call the next day. She never calls back.
So I send a reminder email the next day 02.03.2021, I send another on 19.03.2021. Still waiting for any response. 
Discovery Bank charged me for services I did not use. It is unacceptable to have to go through so much trouble to get Discovery Bank to rectify their mistake.

"I received a mail from Discovery bank advertising a apple watch subsidy, the only cost would be a R10 monthly fee. There were no other conditions on the mail.
Being a pensioner having very few expenses with all debt and assets paid for i applied.


They refused not sure why as there response went to a discovery app i don't have.

Had they said they don't want people with no debt it would save us all time.",1
"Firstly, I am very happy with what Discovery is trying to accomplish with its reward programs (drive, money, and active), BUT read the fine print BEFORE activating your iPhone Benefit!

Let me explain how it works as I had to learn the hard way:
Firstly you need the correct account with the right credit limit to qualify for the benefit. The cheapest account (currently R185 pm) is the Platinum account that requires a credit limit of R20000.

Based on this, the maximum cashback you can get is R500, that is if you reach ALL your goals for the 3 reward programs (money, drive, and active) EVERY month for 24 months. The amount of cashback increases if you open a higher colour account (but that only means you pay a higher monthly bank rate).

SO, let's do the calculations. You will pay, 185 x 24 (bank rate for the platinum account for 2 years) = 4440 out of pocket. 

The cheapest, newest iPhone currently (iPhone 12 mini 64GB) is 17999.

If you look at the max cashback you may get (500 x 24 = 12000), that means you will pay 5999 out of your pocket (17**********0) PLUS the 4440 you need to pay to keep your platinum account active? 

It's also important to remember that you do not need all 3 reward programs to qualify for the iPhone benefit. This is where the kicker comes in. Let's say you do not have Drive, this means you won't get 4 of the 11 goals needed to receive 100% back of the 500 as explained above. You will ONLY receive 25% back of the 500 = 125 cashback per month!!!! 

Again, I think this is a GREAT initiative to get people more active, spend their money wisely and drive better, but if Discovery would like people to activate all 3 of their reward programs, make the reward worthwhile??? Or change the iPhone benefit to work on the same basis as the Apple watch?

I have vitality active and money, but why would I activate my drive reward if the reward isn't even that rewarding in the long run?! 

At the moment it will be easier just to get a phone contract somewhere else. Discovery is throwing away the chance to get more people on their rewards programs...",1
"The iPhone benefit is as close to a scam as you will ever get. They entice you by showing you what you ""expect to pay"" without being upfront on how much needs to happen for this amount to actually be correct. All the conditions are cleverly hidden away and you have to make a real effort to get to them. It might work for some but I am sure they catch out 90% of us.",1
"Applying for a credit card via the Discovery Bank app was a great experience untill the final step of uploading 3 months bank statements. The app expect you to have upload the statements for your phone storage or take a photos.  Who has their  last three month statements on the their phone or printed?  So the app has a note that you can also upload the statements on online.discovery.bank.
On my highly respected Investec bank portal I was able to download the last 3 months statements but unfortunately as 3 different PDF files.  After uplaoding the statements the web page give you no feedback of what was received and what is the next step.  Only a meaningless home page with no information.
Since then there was 3 call center calls, e-mails to credit@dicovery, further uploads of payslips and a lot of wait.   The communication and process is poor.  It would be much better to see on the website what docuemtn you have uploaded and to get teh feedback from credit vetting in the portal and provide further documents.",1
Yes the time has moved on - now 9 months and still no feedback from Discovery Bank- same old .......,1
"For a world class bank (claim!), the service is definitely not up to standard.
I've applied for an account on Tuesday, 29 March via the app.  The next day I followed up, and the lady I spoke to was very inefficient, not knowing which documents I will have to submit.  I've sent my 3 months bank statement, payslip and proof of address to the email address she sent me *********** and received an automated reply that it will take 2 days to receive a response.  I've received emails and sms messages prompting me to upload the docs (which I have sent) via the app or website.  However neither shows outstanding documents.  
I phoned this morning, phone cut (and no one bothered to phone me back).  Phoned again, lady had to transfer me to the credit department.  Got through to Nixon, also completely clueless as to how to resolve this, because according to him, the email sent can't be added to my profile on the backend.  I have to send screenshots of the fact that there isn't an outstanding document message (which screen, 6menu options) to the credit email address (who hasn't responded to my email sent a week ago), to indicate the error.  Then he changed his story, Discovery is aware of the problem.  Then, according to him, I have to withdraw my application and apply again (2 credit application against my credit record).  Long and short, I'm nowhere closer than I were a week ago with my application.  And Discovery Bank service is on par with the major banks, no service whatsover.  Great concept, needs exceptional service to support. ",1
"I'll just have to keep writing negative reviews until one day my issue gets resolved.  Nearly 2 weeks since I applied for an account and zero feedback. After logging a review a few days ago discovery replied saying they'd get back to me.  Based on the reviews here do you think that happened? Of course not, all just lip service.  If you're interested in opening an account with Discovery bank I suggest you read these reviews first and then reconsider.",1
"""Unfortunately we are not responding to emails anymore""

Oh really? I pay literally thousands of rands in annual for the ""privilege"" of this credit card, yet I cannot get absolutely elementary customer service?

The customer service for this card has plummeted since Discovery took over from Visa. I expect a PHONECALL or an functional EMAIL ADDRESS or you can cancel my card immediately, which I've had for almost 20 years.",1
"I ordered my new Discovery Debit Card on Wednesday last week, and it was delivered today - that's including TWO public holidays. My current bank can't do that. Very well done to you - I'm not used to this kind of service from a bank!",5

No one at call center can help me as everyone i have spoken to has confirmed that the card has been canceled...

I recently discovered that DISCOVERY BANK has been incorrectly debiting money from my Standard bank account without my consent for +-5 years.

I first reported this to DISCOVERY BANK on Friday the 25/09/2020 after speaking to a consultant via customer service. I was asked to send the documented proof, which I did and didn't receive a response.

By 25/11/2020 (TWO MONTHS LATER) I still had no response and sent yet another email as the consultant requested with my phone number, ID number and name. Here is a copy of the email:
""""
Good day

I recently spoke to a consultant via telephone regarding an unknown debit order that has been going off for some time now. The consultant requested I send a screenshot of the transaction. As far as I am aware, I have no accounts or policies with discovery.

My phone number is *** *** ***x. My ID number is ***xx ***x ***. My full name is Constant von Berg.

I received no response. It has been TWO MONTHS since my initial report. By this point I'm becoming impatient.

So on 08/12/2020 I sent yet another email corresponding with a consultant named MARUSHA GOVENDER. Here is a copy of the email:
""""
Good day Marusha

We spoke on the phone regarding an incorrect deduction from discovery.

I have attached all the statements I have at my disposal, although I'm beginning to think the deductions go further back than April 2017. I have also attached a screenshot of my standard bank app showing a recent deduction with the name ""DISCBANK DISCBANK **********9"" that is called ""DISCOV"" in earlier transactions.

My phone number is ******x. My ID number is ******xx. My full name is Constant von Berg.

""""

A few days later MARUSHA GOVENDER phones me and explains that the incorrect deduction is an admin mistake regarding an incorrect account number on another person's actual Discovery account. She ensures me Discovery is going to rectify the situation and repay my money. All is well, I gladly thank her for her swift action and I go about my merry way.

By 25/01/2021 (TWO MONTHS LATER) DISCOVERY IS STILL DEDUCTING THE MONEY and still hasn't repaid my money.

On 03/02/2021(A MONTH LATER) I phone again and reach a consultant named LULU. I then send another email with the requested documents. here is a copy of the email in which I also quote the previous email:
""""
Hello Lulu

Here is a copy/paste quote of my message to Marusha Govender. I also attach my bank statements available to me. The date of the original message is 08 Dec 2020. I did also forward the original conversation again to clientdocuments, but I can't update the subject line.

Please reply via email or a quick phone call so that I know the email was received in good order.

I received no update or response after that. 

I then phoned again on the 16/03/2021. I spoke to a consultant named MEME(Mimi). I then sent her another email quoting the previous email.
 
DISCOVERY HAD SINCE DELETED THE ORIGINAL EMAIL CONVERSATION WITH MARUSHA GOVENDER, COVERING THEIR TRACKS LIKE GOOD CRIMINALS. LUCKILY I STARTED RECORDING OUR INTERACTIONS AND HAD A TEXT COPY.

Here's a copy:

Hi Meme, Constant von Berg here. We spoke yesterday regarding a mistaken debit order from discovery that has yet not been resolved or reimbursed. My first inquiry was on September 25 2020. My first successful response from Marusha Govender was on 08 December 2020. The message I sent to Murisha on 08 December is now missing for some reason and I only have the automatic response email in my inbox of the same date. After having no response or interaction, I then forwarded the email to Lulu on 03 February. Here is a copy/paste of previous messages with required documents attached. I will be making backups of our correspondence for further action as I have been as polite and patient as any reasonable person can be. Please help me sort this out. The total amount deducted as far back as 2017(that I can track) comes to roughly  The last deduction was 25 January, not February as I stated in our last conversation, my apologies.

For your convenience, I have highlighted the deductions in the pdf bank statements and made a short summary of deductions with dates and amounts in a txt file.

My phone number is *********. Please phone me so that I know the message was received in good order.

Of course, I got no response or update after that.

I phoned again on 23/03/2021 and got to a consultant name MIHLALI NTONGA. I was asked to send the required documents AGAIN which I did. I was then assured the problem would be sorted out.

It is today 26/03/2021 - 6 MONTHS SINCE MY FIRST INQUIRY AND STILL NO SOLUTION. I am now involving the public, the press and eventually the legal system.

ADDENDUM 1: It is today 05/04/2021. A week and a half later since my last review and 6 MONTHS AND 10 DAYS since the initial inquiry. Not so much as an email or a phone call with and update. The OBSSA will now be notified since Discovery Bank is clearly not intent on paying back the money.",1
"After NUMEROUS calls and 2 weeks later my issue has not been resolved. They confirmed 2 days ago my account will be activated even though the reflects an ACTIVE account, yet i STILL cannot use my card. Totally UNACCEPTABLE!! ",1
So was considering switch from a bank that charged high fees . Signed up at about 6pm in the evening an got a call back within minutes from Kerwin Govender. Gave me amazing service answered all question and all took about an hours... I hope the service carries on.,5
"I never gave permission for FNB to hand over the administration of my credit card to Discovery Bank.  Nothing was verbally or written to this effect giving permission.

I have requested that the card be cancelled and eventually spoke to a call agent who wanted to FICA my details and I do not intend giving earnings amount etc to them as they were asked to cancel the card.  Still they continue to charge and send requests.
The lady said she would deal with this personally and see that the card was cancelled.  As in typical Discovery style this was not done.

I said if it was not done I would go to Hellopeter as a first stop and then further if they did not cancel it.  They did not so here we are.
Discovery bank is not the good bank they make out to be.",1
"I attempted to return an iPhone in exchange for a different model after activating the iPhone benefit on my app. Before returning this unused phone, I called discovery to find out the process, I was told that I can exchange the phone and top up the difference. When I get to the iStore, I’m told there’s no such process and the entire transaction has to reversed and I had to leave the phone there. Whilst the phone has been returned, I am charged internet by discovery on my credit card. 

Not only did I have to call several times to find out and confirm if discovery’s processed this reversal, I would be transferred between departments constantly having to repeat my reason for the call and my reason for being transferred. When that doesn’t happen, the call is dropped on me. Infuriating and shambles 

After days and days, I still have this item reflecting on my app and I still cannot proceed with the device exchange that I was supposed to do in the first place. One agent told me he’d transfer me to a department even though he doesn’t know if anyone from that department would be working and available to accept the transfer to assist. I asked how does he not know if his colleagues are working or not, he said that they’re separate departments. Shambles!

1. Don’t tell customers one thing whilst your affiliate service provider does something else. It’s lying on your part. 

2. Don’t tell customers you’re going to do something and not do it. If you still haven’t done it, don’t wait for your customers to call you. You’re a digital bank. If your customers have to call you for basic updates, you ought to be embarrassed. 

I’ve probably spent hundred of rands on this process already. It’s a shame ",1
Opened account 6 weeks ago for my mother. Card still not delivered. How disappointing. ,1
This is the most useless bunch of people to deal with. Complaining about their extremely POOR service rolls like water off a duck’s back with them. Discovery has locked my card for NO reason and NO-ONE knows why. They keep transferring  my calls to different departments as none of these people knows what is going on and don’t even bother to assist. I dealt with a Yaseen to consider taking short term insurance with DIscovery but not proceeding noe seems to be the best thing decision i’ve made. THE WORST SERVICE EVER!!!,1
"After several attempts. Still can't upload payslips to your app. 
Nothing new. 
Please assist.",1
Finally got my problem resolved. Thanks,5
Despite 2 previous poor reviews on this site and numerous complaints to discovery themselves I am getting nowhere. Their customer service is unbelievably bad. They certainly don't care about their customers. I can't access my own money and haven't been able to for months. Totally unacceptable ,1
"Worst Bank ever!!! No reply on your emails. When answering their phone, you get incompetent staff that always say that they will phone you back.....they NEVER phone back. ",1
Helloooo anybody there? Going on 4 days since my application and dead silence from you guys.  At the point where if this is the application process I dread to see the after sales/customer support............,1
"The debit card delivered to me magically showed incorrect initials.
This is how Discovery Bank does their admin!?
I immediately called and I had to supply documents again to prove I am the person who opened the account, whilst some idiot typed in my initials incorrectly.
And this while the account was opened last week and supporting documents were provided.
Agitated as I was I requested to cancel my accounts and Themba dropped the phone on me; great job! I understand the working remotely conveot fue to the Civid-19 pandemic, but at least a callback if this happened accidentally.
Called for the second time and a lady sorted out my issue. However I will now have to wait till next week to get a card and access to my money.
I hope that Themba does not represent the majority at Discovery Bank.
Remember one rotten apple will spoil the whole lot.
The second to the lady (whose name I do not recall, apologies for that) was helpful.
Just hope this issue with my debit card will be sorted soon.",3
"Horrendous service. 5 days to sort out 1 issue.
I applied for credit. It was granted. Discovery app was blocked due to my cell no and phone changing.
It takes Discovery 5 days to half sort out the issue. No reply to 2 complaints on website and no reply to to replies on Hellopeter.
What is going on with your service Discovery.
Sort out my issue today please.
",1
"This is by far the most unhelpful bank ever. I simply want to change my OTP number and reset the password on my card, but help is just not forthcoming. You end up speaking to a computer most of the time and when you get through to a person they cannot help you and they have to phone back. When they eventually phone back, don't dare miss the call because they don't try to phone back again. Please just help me fix my OTP and pin, PLEASE!!",1
"I am so angry with disc bank!!!!!!! I recently got the new disc bank credit cards. I went out today for a day of shopping and guess what... both my credit cards didnt work!!!!!!! WHY DID DISCOVERY BLOCK MY CARDS?????????? You left me STRANDED! I barely carry cash! I WAS SOOOOOOOOO EMBARRASSED! i HAD TO LEAVE THE MAJORITY OF THE THINGS AND WALK OUT!!!!! On the discovery website, it clearly states that my credit card are active. Active my ASS!!!!!!!! What if I was overseas and want to use my credit card????? WHAT THE HELL ARE YOU UPTO??? SO INCOMPETENT!!!!!!!!!! ",1
"I applied for credit card from discovery bank online.  A consultant called me to process my application.  Discovery rejected my application because Experian is failing to update my profile.  

I just want to thank the consultant she was open,  calm and understanding. That is one quality which a lot of consultants lack. Although she could give me what I wanted because of discovery bad system. She did a good job.  

I wanted to join discovery but Experian ruined it for me and probably other people because they are not updating their system.  I believe discovery bankand other banks have lost customers because of Experian. 

My credit record is perfect healthy if you check on transunion and compuscan. I am just disappoint in discovery bank and our credit bureau system.  

",4
"I decided to open an account with Discovery Bank, it was clearly a bad idea. Sent them all the documentation they required only to get an email saying I must upload supporting documentation, but they don't state what documents? So you are now forced to call the call centre to find out what they require. So I send additional documents only to get another email saying upload documents. Forced to call the call centre again to find out what is required. Why on earth they don't tell you in the email what is required is beyond me. It's extremely frustrating that a company like Discovery is unable to communicate with its customers effectively. 

I have cancelled my application, if it starts like this it will only get worse. Poor show Discovery Bank you have alot to learn.",1
Really struggling to keep my cool with Discovery when all I want is an updated 3 month statement that also doesn't show me as Mr. Don't even dare tell me this will be looked into or escalated. ,1
"Since 2018 I've been unable to open a Discovery Bank Account! I've been sent from pillar to post, spent countless hours on the phone, promised for my calls to be returned and nothing!!! I've been a Discovery client since 2014, yet this is the shocking service that you give your clients! According to Discovery, my ID is blocked and I needed to visit Home Affairs. During the lockdown, I went and Home Affairs informed me that there is no block and issued me with a temporary ID as they couldn't issue me with a letter due to lockdown. I sent this to Discovery bank on 25 January 2021. Now Discovery bank has changed their story again, now the error message reads that I need to go to Home Affairs to apply for a Smart ID. I've been to Home Affairs to apply for a smart ID card and they've issued me with a letter to inform DB bank that there is no block on my ID. This was sent to DB on 19 March 2021. I was promised within 48 hours it will be resolved, STILL WAITING!!! On Tuesday 23 March 2021 I called in yet again wasting my time and money, someone promised to get the managers to access the mailbox and call me back, NOTHING BUT EMPTY PROMISES!!! Today I called in again, and the AGENT wants to transfer me to your collections department!!!! How difficult can it be to get a bank account?",1

I signed up with discovery Bank in December and three out of three months I have not been able to make payments at the end of the month. To top it all off I cannot get onto their banking app. After phoning into the bank their answer was becuase I use a Hauwei device I cannot bank as the app does not open. I cannot understand how a bank that prides themselves on being a app only bank cannot actually support one of the top smart phone devices. Absolutely shocking. After getting the issue escalated they still haven't contacted me even though they sent me an sms saying they would contact me within 48 hours. Do not use Discovery Bank. They cannot support their client base ,1
"Tshepiso Dlamini was really excellent. Asked all the right questions about my request and was knowledable, efficient and quick. Nicely done!",5
"I settle my credit card on 01 March 2020, but the collections manager still has a lock on my account even after bringing it up to date.
I called on 05 March and was told they would look into it and would get back to me which didn’t happen.

On 12 March I called again and spoke to a collections consultant who told me that the manager had already spoke to me which I told her had not happen and I was calling again because no one has bothered to get back to me. She told me the message would be passed onto the collections manager and would get back to me which obviously has not happened.

This week I was charged with monthly account fees and interest on arrears. How is this possible when I firstly am not using the account and how can I be charged interest when I’ve settled my account! 

I would like for discovery to close my account!! This is horrible service and you do not appreciate your clients. I will be moving to Nedbank as I can no longer out up with the lack of service delivery!!!!!!",1
For 3 weeks now I am trying to get Discovery bank to credit my account with the R1000 I paid the account abut they keep sending me arrears SMS's I spoke to Grace TWICE sent emails of proof of payment. I can't be calling all the time ( about 6x ) and holding on for the machine to go through all the options while I am calling from my mobile phone. this is not on it reflects on my credit score that I want to improve,1
Best part of Discovery. Applied for a replacement card yesterday.  Card will be delivered on Friday. Keep it up.,5
"I initially had some issues opening the account, but I am now super impressed. The app is simple to use, and if  you need to contact them they are professional and friendly.",5
"So after almost 3 weeks of trying to open a simple demand account with Discovery bank, I am throwing in the towel. They don't want my business and this might be for the best. I have spoken to no less than 9 customer service consultants in this time and no-one wants to help me. 

I have seen some bad service in my life but this is fairly special. ",1
"Pathetic service from their credit card division. I reported a fraudulent activity and was told I would be refunded. I have reminded them 3 times, and they do not bother getting back to me. STILL WAITING!!! Time to get a standard bank credit card, and leave discovery!",1
"Discovery Bank charge me every month for a facility that I did not request and do not want because their ""system"" cannot stop this or change it.
They reverse the charges each month if I phone in (cannot contact them by email) and spend a long time jumping through hoops to identify myself to an assistant who cannot assist but elevates the matter to someone who can. Despite my repeated requests they cannot remedy this situation and so it goes on. Incompetent bank with poor customer service to be avoided.",1
"I have been trying to open a Discovery Bank account for more than 2 months now. The app doesn't allow me, when I call the center agents refuse to help me, I get transferred from pillar to post with empty promises of people who will come back to me. ",1
I regret the day I opened Discovery bank account which I closed within a short period of time as their are useless. I should have done the same with their credit card but I did not as thought was good. Actually it was  worse to  move of discovery credit card from FNB. It was better managed when it was under FNB. I am struggling to understand the reasons they don't have a credit insurance. I'm retrenched since April 2020 and I applied for credit insurance claim but it seems like emails are not going through. Instead I get calls from MBD that my account has been legally handed to them. They also can't explain why the financial institution like Discovery doesn't have a credit insurance? I am unemployed I cannot afford to pay them until I find a job that's what I told the caller from MBD. This is a company that irritate me with calls every day and when I pick their calls they always drop it. I think something is not right for the consumer to be treated like these. Do I send my complaint about the credit insurance issue to ombudsman or NCR. ,1
"A VERY frustrated customer trying to open a bank account for the past 2 months. I have 20 reference numbers with NOBODY coming back to me. Apparently an IT problem with the app but nobody in the call center knows what to do and keeps “escalating” the matter with NO RESULTS!!!! They are about to lose a young doctor as a customer forever for the most pathetic service I have ever encountered. I will probably move my insurance, medical aid and life cover else where! ",1
Trying to phone the bank not connecting to agents. Please give me a call urgently,3
"I phoned and enquired. They told me to go onto the app, which is still giving me an error stating my nr and ID doesnt match. I told them they better not do an ITC check until my application has been completed and a check affects my ITC score. They still went ahead and did the ITC check and it reflects on my credit report!!! They did that without my consent. I am also going to the ombudsman, and request the voice recordings to be pulled!!. They do not comply with the POPI act and give false advise just to get you to download the app, and mine is still not working. I told them to stop contacting me!! I want the status removed from my credit report TODAY!! you give false information and trick clients and affect their credit score!!!",1
"ATM machine swallowed my card last Sunday, within less than 2 minutes, money was withdrawn from my bank account at an ATM about a kilometer away, I was on a call with the bank to block all my accounts but by then whatever was in my account was taken. I immediately opened a case within an hour and completed all forms. Almost a week later someone from the fraud department called me to say, it looks like AUTHENTICATED CHIP AND PIN TRANSACTIONS. Of course it would, the ATM swallowed my card after I put it my pin so that information was taken, this is generally how all ATM thefts happen. Now I need to prove to discovery bank that I was at the ATM where my card was swallowed. I was only with Discovery Bank for 5 months or so but really disappointed. On the day this happened they can already see that there were multiple failed transactions and 2 successful ones as well as people going to random atms in the area to keep drawing cash... not sure why I still need to prove myself further. Leaving Discovery Bank because I cannot trust the account I have and do not believe it won't happen again. Disappointing",1
I had an account (credit) that was closed and paid in full. Written confirmation of closure received. For months they have continued to deduct an amount without authorisation from my current account. They do not respond to emails nor calls. I have tried to stop and/or reverse the debit orders but it repeats monthly despite all efforts. Worst service ever and be warned....they will leach off you relentlessly even after severing all ties. Is that how they gain a passive income. I'm fed up with Discovery Bank. Please run away from them at all costs. ,1
"Needed to make arrangements for my renewal credit card given that I am currently overseas.  Spoke with Chulu, who provided excellent service and was extremely efficient.  An asset to Discovery Bank!   Thank you. ",5
I opened an account with Discovery Bank. From the onset I had issues with them. Thank God I didn't close my Nedbank account. I have also applied for a credit card to benefit from being a Vitality member but was declined. Funny thing is that Nedbank approved me within 24 hours with a ridiculously high limit. I'm puzzled as to what criteria Discovery uses. All that  I can say is that I am slowly moving away from their products,1
"I tried to speak to someone before opening an account.... impossible, nobody answers the lines. This tells me I should not open an account at discovery",1
I’ve been a client of Discovery bank for a few years and the service provided has always been great and never had any issues with the app. Keep up the good work!!!,5
"If I could rate it Zero I would 

Discovery bank is this how you treat your clients , my card expired in Jan 2021, I immediately called the Callcenter to request for a replacement , because of covid regulations I was informed to register on the discovery app  and proceed from there , which I did successfully, I further called them again and they requested that I send my identification documents to their fica email address, then I waited for over a week and nothing happened , I called the callcentre again on the 4th of february , they informed me that the fica dept says my ID copy is not visible enough, I resent everything , and I was told I will receive an sms from the courier company and further instructions on the app. Ever since nothing has happened no sms or email I have been continuously been calling the callcentre and being transferred from pillar to post with no feedback, yesterday on the 16th march 2021, I was informed by the team leader that he can see my ID copy and he will callback in 15 minutes . To No avail, I called back requesting to speak to the manager I was put on hold for over 15 minutes and my call was dropped , from the incompetent Callcenter agents to the inefficient managers YOUR SERVICE IS Disgusting
",1
"I posted a review more than 72 hours ago. I received a response from Discovery on 14/03/2021 at 12h13 ""Hi, Liora Please accept our apologies for the delay in response. We will check when you will be receiving your Voucher and advise.Regards, Lebohang""
But again they have not reverted to me. Nothing! I feel like going to the S.A. Police and laying a charge of fraudulent inducement. I was promised a voucher, I did what I had to do, and 5 months and many phone calls later, still nothing. ",1
Well I thought I'd give Discovery Bank a try but instantly regret going down this path.  After taking nearly a day to process my application I get a message stating that I have a new offer on the app to accept.  When logging in it says the offer is lower because my declared income was more than they were able to verify (maybe invest in glasses for your staff as the figures on my payslip and bank statements match to the cent).  Anyway the offer is less than half of what I get at FNB so looks like I won't be switching to Discovery.  ,1
"I wanted to give Discovery Bank the benefit of the doubt, but now I know why they are consistently voted the worst bank in South Africa. I have been try for weeks to get one document from them after my father passed away. As if dealing with a loved one's death is not bad enough - Discovery found a way to make it worse. 

The last document the executor needs is a certificate of balance on the date of death and Discovery is unable to provide this one document. After visiting the customer centre, phoning multiple times, emailing consistently, I'm not getting any feedback or service. Our lives are now on hold because of Discovery's gross incompetence. ",1
"I would like to say that the customer service in my experience is amazing, the app works well and the banking fees are reasonable HOWEVER with Discovery being new to the banking world its has been the most frustrating thing for that 5 days of waiting for an international payment to find out Discovery Bank is not authorized to receive international payments. Funds that were meant for an emergency!!! Now the funds have not been reversed back to the sender!!!!! Then all my debit orders with other service providers have not been successful because they dont have mandates with Discovery. So this has really been an absolute frustration for me. Why should I change the way I do things to accommodate Discovery????  Considering I cancelled with my previous banker and moved to Discovery!!  It is for this reason that I will be cancelling all banking services with Discovery. ",1
"That's it finally. Discovery Bank please contact me to discuss terms for the repayment of my credit and severance of all business ties with you.

Discovery Bank sends me an email with a FICA request for details. That's fine, however I am a little suspicious since the account was ""migrated"" over from FNB under a year ago and this bank alleges access to the Department of Home Affairs details.

But fine .. I will send you the silly email, However, here is the REAL. ""Let's have you Mtr/Ms or whatever customer update all your personal financial details while you are about it. Give us all the information - including your weakest debt"" (my paraphrase)

Here it is in corporate speak:

""Please confirm your income and employment information below:
Employment information
Employment status
Industry of employment
Occupation
Gross monthly income
Sources of income for each of your accounts
(for example, interest on an investment, salary, or
owner drawings)""

I am sorry but the above has NOTHING to do with FICA and you are deliberately misleading gullible clients. And what security of information do you offer? We are meant to ""trust"" you?

You accepted my business years ago when Discovery Health lured me into opening a credit card account. I accepted your terms back then and for the record I refuse to accept any further terms.

Whilst we are on that subject. As a bank you have:

1. Increased my credit rate since I held the original ""Discovery Credit Card"" administered by FNB.

2. Increased my monthly charges and then conveniently ""upgraded"" me to platinum with the the lure of a lower interest rate - then failed to deliver.

3. Forced me to use a malfunctioning bank app to ""transfer"" my business. Such a useless application that it took 4 weeks for the ""selfie"" function, alegedly keying into SA Home Affairs database, to recognise me.

4. Finally the fraudulent bit. I am suddenly charged an extra R30 for a ""Vitality Money Premium""   , not explained to me when I accepted your ""migration"" offer so you DO NOT have my acceptance on record, in fact you refused to reverse this on my request - a kind of middle finger to me as a hapless client.

And by the way, I am not the only person complaining. How long before someone takes this to the Banking Ombud?

I am telling you fat cats to go to hell. Bite me.",1
"If you want to be taken seriously and not simply as amateurs trying to appear as a professional service bank, start with the little things, like prioritising your 3D verification online card payment queues. Not for the first time have I sat waiting for the confirmation code to arrive on my phone via SMS, so I can complete an online payment, only for nothing to arrive, the payment transaction to time out, and much later, a sudden deluge of confirmation codes arriving on my phone. Too little too late.

What's more because I requested a resend a few times, in case something got lost in translation, I noted that the flood of SMS's arrived on the hour, which suggests some sort of backend system woke up. As I say, this is not the first time this has happened to me. I won't go near you as a bank until little things like this are no longer an issue. Sorry. ",2
"I saw an add with the statement ""open an account under 5 mins"", so I went and applied. It's been over a week now and all I get is ""your application has been accepted, we will notify you once the account is open"" So on 15 March 2021 I phoned in to ask what is happening with the account. 1st person that answered, could not help me. 2nd person said, send us a screen shot, we are not sure why it's doing this. If this is how it starts..... how will it be once the account is open?",1
Very poor service levels. They cannot resolve an OTP issue. Been trying since January and spoke to about 10 agents . They all promise to resolve the issue and that they would call me back with answers but none of them have been true to their word. Never experienced anything like this from any other bank.,1
You log queries with Discovery Bank and thats where it ends. No one follows up or gets back to you. WRefNo#********** is my reference since January 2021 and still no resolution.,1
"On 13 October 2020 I received an SMS from Discovery inviting me to upgrade my credit card to a Discovery Bank account. I had to click through various steps, which I did. In return, the incentive was a R1,000.00 Woolworths voucher. 
I have not received the voucher, notwithstanding two prior complaints made against Discovery Bank, who responded via HelloPeter on 21/12/2020 that they were in the process of processing the claims. We are now 5 (FIVE) months later and I have still not received the Woolworths voucher. 
I am giving Discovery 5 business days to deliver the voucher to me, that is by close of business on 19 March 2021. 
This is really not the way to retain customers! ",1
"Tried contacting Discovery Bank on several occassions to cancel my credit card, to date my card has not been cancelled and I am being charged monthly fees! Pathetic service from Discovery card and the call centre staff are absolutely useless!",1
"People are normally quick to complain when issues arise with business's and give a bad review, but alas, after 9 months of querying and fighting for my rightful cashback rewards from Discovery Bank for HealthyLiving, and nearly all hope was lost, I can now say that all my queries have finally been resolved. I think they deserve a good review now. They have really upped their game in that department now by getting a specialist team dealing with cashback rewards. Thank you , thank you that's all I can say. Dont give up people there's finally a light at the end of the tunnel. My faith has been restored. Yay!!!!",5
"Albeit this is a generally a total waste of time as Discovery Bank does not deem it necessary to respond, in spite of the ongoing negative and contemptuous posts that are continuously made, Discovery Bank continues to be despicable in its behaviour towards its clients and I need to express my contempt of their conduct and attitude. My daughter who has been living overseas, and has no reason to have this account, has been trying to close her account since May 2020, which she is also unable to even access. She has written, phoned and appealed to no avail. Instead she receives generic responses and money continues to be taken off her account monthly. She has approached senior management and still has not had the courtesy of an acknowledgement or reply.   ",1
"Horrible Horrible Service. There are no statements and payment reminders to my mailbox. App is confusing. I have enough money in my Transaction account, yet after the month, I was unsure how much I owe in credit card. I paid R1000. Apparently I was supposed to pay R1300. One morning, my app was blocked, accounts were blocked as I needed to pay R300 arrears. I couldn't even login and pay R300 from my transaction to credit. When I called, I was told that I need to pay R300 from  some other bank to Discovery and then only they will unfreeze my accounts. So all the money and card and app blocked for R300. Where I had money in my transaction account. Points/Miles and stuff all good, but I don't know how this is justified and explained. Not a reliable bank, just a cashback rewards setup at the moment, but not the one you can move to and close everything else.",1
I've tried to contact discovery on many occasions. My wallet was stolen during April of last year 2020. I struggled to get through to have it blocked and have a new card issued. The charges on the card since the account is clean is 50 rand and I don't mind paying the fee. The issues are as follows they never called me to it replaced. I called them at least 8 times and the phone line disconnected and no one called me back. I have sent numerous emails to call me back. I could not pay the card as I had it saved as a card not knowing there is a different way to add them via eft. No one called me about the card and I couldn't make payment via three banking apps as the card expired. Yet no on called me. Then when I called in the last time the consultant advised the card or account should be migrated from fnb to discovery. No one told me I was overdue. No call what so ever. Then they advised to use the app. The app had an error each time and then the consultant advised I should pay the amount given I paid the account still the app didn't work then a new consluatnt which I had to call in again advised the account is in collections so no called me to advise pay it this way and replace the card. ,1
"1 start rating is TOO MUCH!

Always changing the goal posts, I have medical aid, life insurance, Discovery Bank credit card and vitality. Benefits never seem to work as promised

Needless to say nobody from this ""relevant department contacted me, nor is my problem solved! I still can't sign in on this pathetic Discovery Bank app! It just will not scan the drivers licence. My son, who is a Software Engineer can't get it to work either. I just carry on using my current Discovery card. ",1
"I opened a Discovery Bank credit card in February 2021, with no limit as I wanted to use this as a savings account. The service up until delivering my card was great. I transferred a lump sum of monies into the card. Over the weekend I needed urgent cash and so went to Checkers to draw cash out of my Discovery card where it was declined. I called the call centre and they assisted with the withdrawal limits and said I must wait  10 minutes. I waited longer than 10min and still no luck. I called again, to be told by the agent that i can only use Pick n Pay to withdraw cash, that is not what is advertised on their site, and my phone died on me. When I got back home I called the call centre again, the limits were increased, then the lady told me that i needed to go to a Nedbank to do 2 balance transactions to activate the card and then withdraw cash. She informed me that the transaction can be done at any Pick n Pay, Checkers, Shoprite and other big retailers. She escalated the matter and gave me a reference number. On Monday 8Th March, i went Nedbank, did 2 balance enquiries as instructed. At this point no -one called me from Discovery to inform me of the progress. I went into Checkers at 14Th Ave, to draw cash, far less than my daily withdrawal limit, just for it to be declined again, and the cashier told me its due to exceeding the limit. I called again, explained myself for the 4th time, just be told that he could not see any feedback form the technical team on my query and it could be the card that is faulty, OWM !!! I told the agent that i wanted a manager to call me by 4:00pm, so that I can close my account and transfer my monies out. Guess what no-one has called me. Anyway why did i think that this bank would be different to any of the others in SA :(.

"For the past 3 years I have tried to assist my father in closing a credit card account with Discovery Bank he does not even know how he has it in the first place. Each year he has to pay in money and they say once money has been paid they will close the account. They do not close or and he has to pay in more money. It is costing him and he has never used it does not even know how to or have a card or anything for it yet he must pay. It is so disgusting how someone can be robbed like this.

"Hi, I have been trying to close my Discovery Credit Card for more than 2 weeks now, I have never used the card as a credit card, I have always paid R5000.00 into the account (the maximum spend was also only R5000.00) to gain discovery miles, but seems like only R50 000.00 worth of transactions will gain you any miles to make it worth it.  I am being told that I owe them money to close the account, this is not possible, the first day I phoned them to close the account there was an R17 available balance in the account, I told them to keep it, and just close it, but now almost 3 weeks later the account is still not being closed. I have also been charged for being a secondary cardholder, but I'm the main account holder and only account holder of the card, on the 26th of February they charged me 3 times for being a secondary cardholder, and the biggest concern is that the statements they have on their system are different to the ones I download from the Discovery Bank internet banking. This is very frustrating. I hope this can be resolved soon. Every time I phone you need to explain yourself to someone new. It is very unprofessional, no one even gets back to you. I have been speaking to Janine Gouw, Lulu, Tissany, Thepo, and Mnima. ",1
"hi am writing this for the fourth time and hope this time it will be resolved. i used to have a discovery card on my FNB portal linked to my fnb account because it was easy and transparent. 

by then this card was part of my FNB cards as it appeared on my FNB PORTAL  but then it disappeared without a notice and i decided to cancel the card on the Discovery platform because i did not see how i was going to use the card since i couldn't even do direct deposit to my card as well . 

i am now charged for a card that i canceled since it moved away from the FNB and this is a fraud by the bank if you can notice i dont even have an account NUMBER FOR this bank but you keep charging me.. 

Please cancel my card and reverse all those charges you put every month since you moved away from FNB without informing property so that i can make ways for my self to adapt to your systems. 

there was not even a notice that i will not see the card on my fnb portal anymore 

you don't even reply email because you are just busy scaming people. this bank need to be reported to ombudsman for the its concept of making money without service ",1
"I have never been this disappointed in anything. I made a payment to the most reliable crypto application I know (Luno). These funds were not received by them for weeks and when finally enquiring, Every sales agent I came in contact with made me believe that the bank I had paid through (Standard Bank) was at fault, I was sent on a wild goose chase for months. When following up I found out later that my case was closed with out my consent by one of the agents

I stumbled across their fraud department much later who when told of this, expressed their disbelief that the consultants couldn’t handle the claim for me swiftly...Query still not resolved

I was willing to let this pass but just yesterday I attempted to withdraw money and failed, received messages of my transaction being reversed yet my bank balance remains the same and now 2 more withdrawals taking place that I know nothing of. Immediately called the bank and I was quickly told to wait it out as it will reflect eventually...nothing

I resonated with this Bank as soon I heard it was getting launched. You guys have a great model, would hate to revert to my old Bank",1

"I opened a black account at Discovery Bank. I was impressed with their offerings. They then enticed me to get a credit card by offering me 5000 miles and more benefits. It seemed great, but on opening the credit card they took all my spend on my debit card exercise points to miles away from my debit card, which at that point I still had not received my credit card. I have spoken to their service agents Nandi, Bashani & Shrivor to help sort this out. I just don’t seem to make any progress. I getting a bit worried about transferring my life saving to Discovery Bank if they don’t act in their clients best interests. Let’s see how this plays out, I have ceased using the account and will make a decision with the next week as to whether I stay with them",1

September 2020 I was phoned by debt collectors for the very same issue I had in 2019 and again, I contacted discovery credit card to follow up on why I'm being charged interest on fees with a prepaid credit card that was meant to be cancelled in 2019. They escalated the matter to have the fees reversed and again requested the cancellation of the card. Feb 2021 and I have been charged more interest on fees for a card that was meant to be cancelled in 2019 and on fees that was meant to be reversed.

"I have had a Discovery credit card since 2010 when they were still with FNB, I loved it and their rewards system back then was great and simple, I have always been a big advocate in promoting their rewards program. I was converted to the new Discovery Bank a while back and was considering taking more of their services, luckily, I have not done so yet. The new Discovery Bank and all its services and rewards is a disaster and too complicated, on paper their rewards and cash backs sound amazing, until it needs to be paid out to you, it doesn’t happen! I truly believe their systems in the back end are not working properly yet and calculating it incorrectly. To make matters worse, calling the call center is even worse!

I made a big transaction on 18 Dec 2020 that’s why I picked up my cash back miles discount was not paid back to me. I logged a call, I have easily called the call center 15+ times, no solution or no person who is willing to make sure my issue gets resolved. I even compiled a document with screen shots, pulled all my transactions into a spread sheet and made a recon to indicate it was never paid back to me, no joy. Each time I call in, I only get transferred between Banking team and Vitality team, no one willing to ensure it gets resolved even though its already over 2 months outstanding.

I have so many Ref numbers, but no concrete resolution yet. I only started keeping a log from about mid-January when I realized I am being taken for a ride here.
Between the Banking team and the Vitaliy/Rewards team, I spoke with the following people:
•	Gillian, Ndu, Sasha (some team leader)
•	Levi (not sure about correct spelling), Jacques
•	AJ/Ajay (not sure about correct spelling)
o	He promised to give me feedback, I sent all my proof through to ***********, he never came back to me
•	On 8 Feb 2021 spoke with Ntando, promised me feedback in 2 days, never came back to me
•	On 11 Feb 2021 spoke with Phato, promised me feedback within 1 hour, called me to say nothing yet, promised more feedback by end of that day, never came back to me
•	On 18 Feb 2021 spoke with Divani, promised me feedback by end of the day, she did call me back by end of that day, saying they are looking at it and they will get back to me, today is 23 Feb 2021, no feedback or solution yet.

If anyone wishes to join Discovery purely on their Rewards marketing campaign, I would strongly suggest you reconsider, as I said, I loved their rewards until before they moved away from FNB, their current systems are too complicated and it seems there backend systems are not geared for it yet. I even had issues last year with my shoe booster, was “stuck” in the system for over a month before they resolved it. I am sure I am not the only one they have cheated out of the Miles discount/cash back, I only noticed it because I made a big transaction, so its noticeable. I have all my proof and reference numbers which I can’t share here, but available should anyone want to query it, Discovery also has it, sent it to them a while ago already. To me, honesty, transparency, accountability and helpful service is very important, something I have not received from Discovery.

After the transfer from FNB to Discovery bank R15 046.12 has disappeared as well as a payment of R4791.39 is not reflecting on my account. 
After sending 8 - 12 emails to different email addresses to Discovery Bank (confirmation received of delivery) I have had NO response to the issue. 
I have been an avid supported of the Discovery ""family"" and enjoyed the culture that they have created. I have never defaulted on any payment until two months ago. I instructed my bank to bounce the payments. Now I receive continuous text messages that they have tried to get hold of me but don't have any missed calls listed.
Finally I received a call from Discovery (six months of complaining) that they are going to hand my account over for collection as I have returned two months payments. Now maybe someone can help me. 
It is disgusting and appalling that I can have to default on payment to get attention. ",1
"I have tried to become  client for weeks now. Im a private wealth client at another bank. They keep telling me they wont do a credit check until my doc received as I made it clear it affects my score!! Got my report, and true as hell they did the check, but when I try for days to login to the app it says my cell nr and ID does not match. I keep on telling them this!!! Nothing gets done to fix it. If my crefit query is not removed from the credit checks at all institutions in the next day I am going to the ombudsman. Its the worst experience ever!! They can keep their account. If the service suck this much before you join and they lie to you about your check and affecting your credit score before how will it be once you a client. 1 day to have it removed from ITC and Experian or Im goong to the ombudsman and the call that is recorded will be proof where they said the check wont be done before docs are received and affect my score!! I couldnt send the docs as the app login never worked. Im over this. I am giving them 1 day then Im going to the ombudsman. Done!!! ",1
"I recently upgraded my bank account with Discovery Bank and moved my car insurance to Discovery in order to qualify for the Iphone 12 benefit. 

Discovery's website offers vague and unclear information about the product and only when you read 7 pages of the terms and conditions (which no retail client will do), do you realise the extremely punitive measures Discovery will and does take against you for arbitrary actions (that I will describe below) with no warning.

On activating the benefit, a budget facility is activated equal to the cost of the Iphone. Having not seen this referenced on Discovery's website, I settled the budget account as I did not want to pay interest as indicated on my app (but NOT EXPLAINED on the website - the website does not reference the budget facility, that interest is charged on the facility or that settling the facility irrevocably cancels the product and its benefits). Furthermore, the app, when settling the budget facility, does not warn you that you are about to irrevocably (but arbitrarily) cancel your benefits.

This is where my nightmare with Discovery began. I phoned the call centre on another matter and was told by the agent that my benefit had been cancelled.
This did not and still does not reflect on the app, i.e., it shows that the benefit is still active. I only stumbled across this issue because I happened to phone Discovery on another issue - this is totally inappropriate and your retail banking clients should not pay your school fees for your ineffective and underdeveloped app that clearly doesn't link properly to Discovery Bank systems. 

To reiterate, at no point, on settling the budget facility, which I assume is the reason the benefit was cancelled, is there a warning that the benefit would be cancelled.  

I have phoned numerous times and the matter has been passed from consultant to consultant. I merely want to reinstate the benefit but have been told that the system does not allow for that. While in itself a terrible excuse, it is indicative of the poor quality of the Discovery Bank systems which caused this problem. If this was Investec, a plan would have been made.

The consultants have told me that this has happened to multiple clients but there is nothing that they can do. They refer to page 7 of the terms and conditions where one sentence references that if you pay back the budget facility, the benefit will be cancelled. Discovery clearly does not understand the nature of their retail client base as they do not talk you through the arbitrary consequences relating to their products, nor do they reference them in their marketing materials. This is inappropriate conduct for a digital bank offering highly complex lending products and associated “benefits”.

I bought an Iphone for R19000, assuming that if I meet my goals, I would earn back R15000 in 24 months. So effectively, Discovery Bank has cost me R15000 for no good reason and is totally unwilling to assist. Additionally, they charge interest on the amount outstanding which is not referenced in their marketing and is inappropriate financial conduct for a retail financial institution like Discovery Bank.

I am disgusted in the service I have received, appalled that Discovery is happy to let their clients loose R15000 arbitrarily due their opaque, vague and over-complicated products.

Given what I have gone through and the financial loss I have suffered, I intend to do the following:

1. Report Discovery Bank to the Financial Sector Conduct Authority for inappropriate conduct in relation to their retail client base
2. Report Discovery Bank to the National Credit Regulator for the opaqueness and hidden fees and interest in their lending products offered to retail clients with an inappropriate level of explanation and disclosure
3. Report Discovery Bank to the banking ombudsman 
4. Cancel all my products with Discovery Group
5. Request that my family and friends cancel their products with Discovery Group     
6. Help educate other potential victims about the severe consequences emanating from the arbitrarily complex products that Discovery Bank offers to retail clients by posting about my experiences on social media and sites similar to HelloPeter so that they do not suffer a material financial loss due to Discovery Bank’s lack of disclosure and arbitrary rules.

I am not asking for a lot - I want the product to be reinstated (which would put Discovery in the same position as it always was - without the pathetic excuse that the systems do not allow for this) or I want 100% of my money back on the purchase of the Iphone.

I expect a call from someone at Discovery Bank senior enough to make decisions on Monday 22 February 2021 or I will begin steps 1 to 6 detailed above.

Regards,
Kayla

"Absolutely useless customer service, it is unacceptable in this day and age that people can still accept this type of service. I have given up trying and hope in the inept service I have received in trying to sort out a simple issue. Ever since they moved away from FNB, I have been trying to load the app on my phone. Every time, I get a sms stating that my ID differs from the information they have on their system..... it is countless times that I have phone in... held on forever explained the situation. I have had the same e-mail address for more than 20 years..... I have had the same cell number for 15 years plus. I have had promise from various people saying that it will be sorted out, still no help. I have complained before, and complained again. Just no interest from the fools that ""work"" there.",1
Account was migrated from FNB to Discovery bank. Glitch in their process. My bank card was disconnected and still waiting for the renewal card.,1
"I read various poor reviews on Discovery Bank and decided to decide for myself. 
I attempted to open a bank account. They did not accept my lawyers letter with proof of my new address for Fica. I explained that I recently purchased a property so had no record of any statements of account. I attempted to get an affidavit but left the police station empty handed after 2hrs.
I returned the next day and was successful obtaining an affidavit. I submitted it. I heard nothing. I then phoned after waiting all day for correspondence. I explained I wanted to move my bank. I was cut off after 15 minutes of waiting for the Fica department. 
I phoned again, asking that they return my call. I verified my details and am still waiting for their call, half an hour later. 

I need to trust the institution where I invest my money. 

What can be done? They are making it challenging to do business with them.

According to your agent, I should get an ""Outstanding actions"" prompt which I didn't. Now the technical department is taking its sweet time. Now the app has blocked me from applying. Do you not want me to take the product?",1

I asked them about the 8 weeks, they only said they are processing the claim. l sent follow up email on the 10/02/2121 to Staffbenefits to advise how long i still need to wait, the response shocked the living out of me.,,,, it reads ""Thank you for contacting us. Your claim is in process and is currently being priorotised as it has a technical issue. As soon as we get a resolution ,we will continue with the process and urgently finalise. We wish the circumstances were different and do apologise for the inconvenience. Kind Regards Discovery Employee Benefits Staff Fund team"".. Correct me "" My claim"" not ""we have a system issue regarding claims"". Such a big company to have a technical issue on just my claim. I want to know when am i getting my money as i have given all that is theirs. If they think i have ran out of energy from taking them on, i want them to reply to everyone here and say it. I want my money. The Manager can afford to pay me my money from his or her salary the way that bank is so loaded. Can the CEO or Head of Capital pay me from their incomes,

"Last year I tried to switch my Discovery credit card  to a Discovery Bank credit card. This I could not do as the Discovery Bank app is not compatible with my Samsung J1 phone.
Last month I upgraded to a Samsung J3, the app is now compatible with my phone. For 3 weeks I have tried to sign in on the app, but could not finish the process. Reason: the automatic scanning of the drivers licence does not work!
I called the bank over this period and spoke to 3 different consultants. The first one said I should scan the drivers licence with my printer/scanner and email it to an address given to me. Nothing happened, nobody contacted me. On 10 Feb I spoke to consultant AJ, who asked me to send the email for his attention. He promised to contact me, by this morning nothing happened. I called again and spoke to Phathu, he promised to get someone to call me.
Just after lunch AJ called and we went through the sign-on process on the app. As soon as I got to the scanning step (he suggested I scan my ID), nothing happened. I tried it under various light and background conditions.
After this he said an IT guy will call me, which did not happen.
I agree with the many complainants, that this bank app is useless! I suppose I will never become a Discovery Bank client. The service sucks!",1

Each time I call, I would get a reference number but no feedback thereafter.

"I have to say I am dismayed and disgusted by the level of service and lack of basic communication from Discovery bank.

I had such high hopes, but after sending my proof of address more than 5 times to your Fica team and staff members I keep getting calls regarding my documents being outstanding.

Is it really that hard for 1 person, or 1 department to do their job and look at a document, instead of calling me week after week requesting the same damn document??

It takes me about 20 minutes to open a bank account anywhere else in South Africa, and about 2 days to open one anywhere in the WORLD, but with Discovery Bank it takes over 2 MONTHS??

If you guys wish to compete at all, you need to get your **** together – because this is not acceptable at all!

Either sort out my account or stop calling me asking me for the same ****, having me send it, promising to call me back the same day only for somebody else to call back a week later as if I had not sent anything – ever.

"If it was not for the 3rd call center agent I spoke to today, this rating would have been one star ""Bad Service"". Here is my story changing it to 3 stars as Discovery Bank might be able to use it to improve their ""fancy"" system...

I have been struggling for more than 6 months to close a Credit Card Account that was transferred from FNB to Discovery Bank as part of my Discovery portfolio. 
I've sent emails, made calls, then someone managed to convince me (regrettably) to stay on until the transfer happens to Discovery bank and they will wave the cost. Cost were waved for +/- 4 months. Thank you for that.

My Discovery Bank experience was very frustrating to say the least.
Firstly you are not able to correspond via email to ensure your have written correspondence. You need to call a call center...
They have some fancy phone system...Takes you about 5 minutes just to work through the options and a OTP verification process to get to the correct department before you can actually speak to someone.
Thereafter they have yet another OTP verification process...which sends delayed OTP's to your cell phone (FYI - I'm connected to MTN and always received top network service from them at the location I phoned from). Needless to say, by the time I get the OTP as an sms, the automated message kicks in stating ""Failed Verification"" and the agent cannot access my account.
Now...I need to answer verification questions manually (which I red the answers from the Discovery web site on my portfolio, however verification failed...TWICE...) (By the way - I did have the account number, and my ID, etc. etc. at hand). 

After each failed attempt, you need to call back and for through the 5-8 mins process again to get to speak to an agent.  How ridiculous is that? I only wanted to cancel an unused account I do not even have a card for and paying monthly fees on!!

After I refused to call back and insisted to stay on the line until the matter is resolved, I eventually got transferred to a very friendly, helpful agent by the name of Nicoline. She managed to verify my details successfully and at last I have confirmation of ""Cancelation in Progress"". Let's see if the R2.24 service fee accumulated for 3 days in Feb gets waved at least.

@Nicoline - I am so sorry that I accidently ended the call after you have asked me to stay on for a rating! Thank you for calming me down and resolving the matter successfully. You are a great asset to Discovery Bank!

To the two other agents who said they cannot do anything more for me - There is ALWAYS a solution! Customer Service is the key in the banking industry even if a customer wants to cancel a service, who knows when I need another bank in future... ",3
"I have been trying to get discovery bank to decrease my credit card limit since monday (1 Feb 2021).
The consultant i spoke to on monday said it should be done by the end of the day but still there is nothing. I have been following up since yesterday and this is just frustrating because this a very simple request.
With other banks you can even do this on the online instead of having to hold calls for long. This is very disappointing and i am starting to regret having moved my credit card to this bank.",1
I have been trying to resolve a issue with Discovery Bank paying with an EFT or Discovery miles to buy prepaid electricity. They have acknowledge that there is a problem and advised that I contact the meter manufacturer. Which I did and they responded that on their side they cannot see any problems and request that I purchase the electricity from another bank account. I then purchase the electricity with an FNB account with no problem This proof of purchase I forwarded to Discovery Bank and the only answer I got is that a banker will contact me.  The reference no is **********. ,1
"On the 4th of January made a large purchase online to a foreign merchant and since one cannot put it on budget online, I immediately phoned Discovery to ask that they put the transaction on budget. They advised me to phone back one week later when the transaction has settled.

So it turns out the transaction settled the next day in time for the closing of my monthly statement.

I phoned back on the 11th of January (as per the advice given), asking to now put it on budget and they gladly send the query to whoever and ensures me everything is fine. They did not inform me that they failed in doing that.

So now the full amount is on my statement and it cannot be changed and I as the client is out of pocket.

The agent today really tried his best in assisting me but ultimately Discovery advised that I should have phoned sooner (basically in the window between the transaction settling and the closure of my monthly bill cycle).

This is a very bad customer experience and it leaves me in a predicament.

In the future, I won't use my Discovery card for important transactions as I just cannot trust them to follow my instructions and giving me proper advice and feedback when they failed to execute. In time, I might even close my account as this is not the service I expect from my bank. My bank should be the one place to be sensitive about my financial matters.",1
"I have medical aid, Vitality, and Insurance with Discovery. I decided to take the plunge, and maximise my rewards by joining the Bank as well when FNB began pushing me to move to Private Clients.

I called the call centre, and my call cut after 10 minutes on hold. Frustrataed, I looked for any mail address to use, and my only option was the complaints mail address. Explain my story, and finally I get feedback. Thuto calls me and we have a great chat, I'm finally recovering some faith, and as he transfers me to Vitality team to clarify two more points, the call cuts out again after 10 minutes on hold. I mail the complaints mail again and 4 days later, no response. I so badly want to buy in to Discovery Bank, but if I can't even get contact from anyone through the site, app or phone line, it's literally impossible for me. Then you expect me to upload all my documents, and place my finances in your hands? Not likely, when it feels like you don't even want my business.",1
"When I write complaint earlier this week Discovery re Uber (which does not reply to a complaint) said it would reply to me. I was sent a a document to get the debit orders to Uber reversed. I filled it in then I receive a response asking for the same information I had already provided. To repeat when you go to the Uber application to deal with the debit order you get put in a loop that just goes round and round.
Quite clearly the Bank does not read responses and simply sends out the same requests (also in a loop). ",1
"I made an immediate payment on Sunday to my FNB account from my Discovery Bank account to make payments (rent, accounts) however it never reflected in the other account. It seems now that it was rejected by FNB and should have reversed back into my Discovery account which up to now has not happened. I am now late with my payments and not getting any answers from Discovery Bank. The money is not in any of the suspense accounts at FNB. ",1
"I filled in an online form to apply for a bank card and I have to received a call back. I've been waiting for since last week Monday. Make it easy for us to apply online if your sales team doesn't process online applications. Someone us don't have time to call. I'm free now at 7am and the call centre is closed. I'm available after 8Pm. Anyway, please arrange with someone to call me tomorrow or Thursday anytime. ",1
"I cancelled my card, which was fully paid off. I received confirmation of cancellation.
To my surprise Discovery is still billing me for a ""credit facility"". When I try to log in, I am informed that I do not have an account.
The only electronic forim of contact they have seems to be the complaints@ email address. I receive only automated confirmations of receipt from there, no response to my complaint. How do I get them off my back?",1
As my insurance and medical aid is with discovery I thought of moving my bank account to improve points. I am continously being asked for same documents even after they confirm receipt. Waste of time.one week later and no further. Now I have to shop for a new medical aid and insurance provider. ,1
"Are you really going to keep quiet, my husband H Moruti has been struggling since last week Thursday to use the account, we really need that money urgently. we called on the day we had issues and we were told it will be resolved but still its not working, you guys have big problems, just shut your bank down because you are clearly failing your clients. definitely leave real banking for other banks who knows what they are doing..",1
"I was called by an agent to find out if I want to apply for a credit card with Discovery bank. In an attempt to move as much as possible to Discovery like my insurance, banking, Gap Cover, life insurance etc. I thought that this made sense. 

However I have now tried 3 times unsuccessfully to apply for the credit card via their banking app. IT DOES NOT WORK!!! 

Every time I call in they can not see that I have done any application and insist on taking me through the application process again. I'm at a point where Discovery have already sent me a credit quote and agreement yet they say I have not done an application. I wonder if they realize that this has a direct impact on your credit rating each time you do an application for credit?

I am not even a customer yet, and I am frustrated beyond belief. I'd advise anyone to instead stick to what they know and keep their accounts exactly where they are. ",1
Very bad customer service. I signed up at the beginning of December 2020 and have been having issues so far every single month. I probably called in about 24 times already spend countless times on the phone and being transfer from one person to the next. When you call in to follow up on your inquiry reference number it always gets escalated but never resolved. The app also doesn't work properly the discounts it's saying you are getting is not the same as what they are paying me back in discovery miles. ,1
"I logged a complaint with Discovery Bank in September 2020. This issue has still not been resolved. I have been promised an escalated return call, but this has not happened. I have phoned 15 times if I have phoned once to try to get this resolved, but it would appear that Discovery Bank are hoping that this will simply go away. An absolute travesty of customer service. If you are looking for a banking partner, don't bother with Discovery Bank. ",1
Was thinking of opening an account with them but now after seeing all these reviews. I think I will pass on this one.negative reviews one after the other.,1
"Last week saturday , i made a payment into my newly formed discovery account via a checkers money market- this was after the teller confirmed that they accepted payments into discovery bank , once no deposit had cleared into my account i went back to checkers who asked me to contact my bank on calling discovery they said they do not accept payments from checkers and to go back and ask for a refund 
Checkers then put a missing payments enquiry , discovery had said they cannot assist 
Today checkers (whose negligence incited this whole issue) has reported that their financial services provider paid my money back into the card and to contact discovery 
On doing this I was informed  discovery that they have no payment reflecting and I should go back to checkers

Let me say its been a week later and checkers has tried to assist but discovery has been of absolutely no use , as a client of another bank i can say that the service has been beyond poor with no regard for the client or their finances 
With the only feedback being - go back to checkers , if this money was paid into the card by checkers service provider who is standard bank why can discovery not locate or investigate this matter?

I am a client of discovery medical aid over 6 years and receive excellent service from them , therefore i opened a bank account , but the service of the banking sector has left me appalled IS MY MONEY GONE UP IN SMOKE ? OR SITTING  IN SPACE SOMEWHERE ?  
I fully intend to cancel of this account once this matter is resolved 

disgusted, disapointed  and at a loss due to being put into a financial loss due to this matter",1
"I reported a disputed transaction on 12.9.2020.  

I submitted it as a dispute on 24.9.2020.  Email address on the form I completed and submitted was 'no longer in use'.  Discovery gave me another email address ***********.

3.11.2020:  I forwarded my dispute form again to service, discoverycardadmin and fraud_detection.

24.11.2020 (repeated the latter).

14.12.2020:  'System crashed.  Will call you back.' Never did.

24.12.2020:  Anerson told me he has opened a new fraud case#**********.

26.12.2020:  I was told they cannot assist me.

Called again and spoke to Kaylin, who gave me a new email address...

31.12.2020:  Linda (supervisor/manager) assured me she would listen to the recordings and revert back to me.

7.1.2021:  Lulu advised me that the query had been escallated...

29.1.2021:  Sannah returned my call and advised that 'no exception can be made to dispute the transaction with the merchant, as it is beyond 120 days'.

Who is in charge of the staff managing these issues and WHY has this not been handled competently?

It was reported as a DISPUTE on 12.9.2020; submitted as a DISPUTE on 24.9.2020.

WHY was the dispute changed to FRAUD, and WHY DID I GET ABSOLUTELY NOWHERE WITH THIS?

'Protecting Our Clients....  Passionate about Service Excellence' - Definitely not!!!",1
I dont use that account but they keep charging inte6for what I asked them to close it but no they dont. Money making ,1
"They have advertised their bank and encouraged people to move their salaries with them, now that it happened, we get a lot of problems, we cant even use the card. their service has been down since yesterday and till today it hasn't been fixed, we have emergencies all they told us yesterday was it will be fixed before close of business and it wasn't, still today we are still told the same thing, do you guys know that we have bills to pay? if there  are glitches it must be fixed within a day. we are talking about our money that needs to  work.",1
Discovery Bank and Uber seems to have a nice never reply to emails review going between them. Uber created a system tp sign on  for a monthly discount that did not want but I pushed the wrong button. Since then I have been trying to get them to reverse it. They don't reply to emails. So I then tried to get Discovery Bank to reverse the entry. They don't reply to email or tell you that the email is no longer functioning. Phoning them is quite useless they never come back and use people that are not properly trained. If one uses the BOT  it only asks simple questions. Dealing with Discovery bank is becoming increasingly more difficult. Discovery also provided an email address for Uber which simply does not work.,1
" I have been a client of Discovery for over 10 years. But seems impossible for them to migrate my old credit card I had before they opened there ""bank"" to a new account  and provide me with a card.  It's taken 3 months and still nothing. Pathetic.
 ",1
A year and a half to try close a bank account. Yesterday I was bounced from department to department I spoke to 14 consultants and no closer to closing the account. I get charged fees every month. Is this a joke!! I actually can’t believe what’s going on. A disgrace!! It’s theft!! ,1
"The customer service is non existent. They make promises that the refund is under investigation and will take 21 business days and then nothing happens. I call again after 21 days and every time you call the call center, you talk to a new person and have to explain the whole case again. Then they call you back and inform you that they will request the manager to get an update and you must wait 21 days.

They never call you back or send you any correspondence to inform you of actions that was taken, nothing. Then you have to call Discovery bank again just to be told its under investigation.

Don't bank with Discovery Bank, there is no customer service! At least with FNB I can go to my local branch, I know the staff first hand as I have banked with them for several years and all my concerns and complaints has been resolved swiftly and timeously every time. not the same can be said about Discovery bank

I have been requesting a credit that was processed to me by merchant since September 2020 and its still not resolved, in other words DB has still not credited my account .

",1
"I am absolutely disgusted with the service i have received from discovery, I have requested for a new card on the 17/01/2021 i received a sms from DSV stating that i will be contacted regarding the delivery of my card. I waited the whole week and didn't receive any feedback i then contacted discovery and the agent advised that DSV had an incorrect number for me i don't understand how that is possible as i have received 2 sms from them advising that the driver will be in contact to deliver my card. I then received my card today the 27/01/2021 and i tried activating my card but it states on my app that my card is not eligible for unlocking, I have called discovery bank and the agent couldn't advise me on a time scale that i will be able to use my card. The agents are not trained properly as we as clients need to know this information. I spoke to a manager who wasn't very helpful as i couldn't access my app and speak to him at the same time i requested if he can call me in two minutes but he said he can only call me before 7pm, instead of calling me back. 

I referred 3 of my friends to discovery but i will make sure that they bank elsewhere the service is absolutely pathetic ",1
"This terrible run in with Discovery is happening for the second time. I’m extremely upset and very much inconvenienced with the inability to have access to my OWN money because of their poor customer service.

It’s been 26hrs in waiting for Discovery Bank Product department to call me and confirm the penalty fees for an early withdrawal.
This is PATHETIC!!!

I made 4 calls since 26 Jan’21 09:01 to date 27 Jan 09:27 and I’m still waiting. All the agents are telling me, we have escalated and someone will  call you shortly.

I gave them a benefit of the doubt on my first issue but here we go again. This solidifies that I might be better off elsewhere. They are such an Epic Disappointment!",1
"Discovery Bank made a mistake and reflected an outstanding balance of R32k on my account. I contacted them and the matter was rectified. When applying for the Apple Watch benefit through Vitality I'm told that I don't qualify because my account has not been in good standing for 3 months consecutively. They acknowledge that the error was theirs but they cannot override their system. So even though it was their error, I am still regarded as a credit risk and do not qualify for benefits. ",1
"I called in on monday the 25th of January wanting to cancel my interest free account and was told that it will take 24hours for the cancellation department to do that,someone will call me to confirm before closure.till to date nothing has been done.",1
"No communication about account suspensions due to non-use, and when you call for assistance, you get the runaround and no feedback.  Then when you try to close the account even more drama.  Good riddance.",1
"Since September it has been a constant struggle to get my virgin active monthly contribution cashback as promised after 5 working days from debit order date. Each time I have to phone in and ask what is going on, fund is not reflecting in my vitality account, I am on 100% cashback. After numerous phone calls and e mails one consultant told me that there has been system problems, none of the other incompetent agents could have told me that? So since September last year I have been calling untill my money was paid into my vitality savings account. My debit order is the 1st of each month for virgin active, so +- 1 week after that i have to get my cashback as per your promised terms ""5 days after debit order"" Well its January 2021 already the 25th and still haven't received my cashback??? Once again i have to phone and wait +-15-20 min on a call for your agents to try and do their job? I phoned in twice, now the issue has been escalated to numerous departments but it seems no one know how to do their job? But if a debit order does not go through and I miss my payment date you guys are quick to sh** your pants, but we as clients have to beg for our money that we have worked hard for to earn back? Discovery has become a big f joke all over each department you are nothing without your clients, and looking at how many Facebook commenters there are i am not the only one that is unhappy with services through discovery! I have requested help on the 13th giving you guys more than 2 weeks almost after my debit order to see what happens, 25th already 12 days after my query still no feedback??? ",1

"My discovery bank app shows that I qualify for 34% cashback on Healthy Foods, but with my December cashback, I realized there is something very wrong! I am only receiving 11%!! I am not sure when the issue started- I have asked too many times to give me my qualifying spend for the previous months so I can determine since when I have received below my %cashback - each time met with a different excuse - why do you want to hide this information?? I've been told that it will be emailed to me - also to no avail. Wanting this massive issue to be resolved, I have been speaking to a number of support consultants, but it is clear they are unable to assist me as the matter is ''very complicated''. Each gave me a different reference number to the *****y- only for the next consultant to tell me to wait another 5 working days for feedback.  I no longer trust Discovery. There is no transparency. It is infuriating as I moved everything incl medical aid, bank, car insurance, and home insurance to Discovery. 
If this matter is not resolved by the end of January I have no other option but to cancel all my discovery products.

"Been a loyal client with Discovery Health for more than 15 years, and was looking to adding to the enhancing and moving my services i.e. insurance & banking to discovery as i use the vitality health. Discovery bank were not willing to listen or even understand or customize a profile to best suit what i was looking at. they have declined the credit card application, by excluding certain variants of income. i was seriously considering moving insurance & bank accounts, but this experience was poor to say the least. i can understand reasons for being declined, however to not be willing to listen or understand what i was intending to do was really poor on the part of the company.

"Its sad to say this big of a company service is so bad,no its worse than bad.I given them 1 star by accident. 
Last year March Discovery changed from fnb to there own bank or somghing like that.In that change over they some how lost my details.So they back on my old  details old phone number old email address they increased  my credit  card limit with out me knowing. 
So i call them numerous times(+30 times not joking)to solve this probleme.IN ALMOST A YEAR NOBODY AT DISCOVERY COULD HELP ME TO RESTORE MY CURRENT  PHONE NUMBER AND ADDRESS. They  just told me they have to sent it to a certain department and they will call me.Geuss what they never call me.This is the servise you get from DISCOVERY BANK.
After  10 month's this issue is still not sorted out..
A really got the worst servise ever from Discovery bank....

They don't even deserve this one star cause their service is next to none existence. A simple to check and provide surely cannot take 3 days. Worse without any update or feedback if there any delays. No wonder African Bank's social media team wiped the floor with you on the BrandsEye report. YOU ARE USELESS!!,1
"I migrated my Discovery FNB credit to Discovery bank. Discovery sent me a new card, which I activated. I tried to pay at 2 different locations and the card got declined. I called Discovery to enquiry what went wrong. Discovery says the card could be damaged, I find it weird because I had just received the card. The Consultant then refers me to fraud department not sure why, they checked the account and said its active. Then the fraud department says to me what do you want me to do????? All I want to be able to swipe the card and have a successful transaction I thought thats the point of the bank. The person said they will get a consultant to call me. Its already been 3 days since the call, NOTHING FROM DISCOVERY BANK. DISCOVERY MAYBE BANKING ISNT FOR YOU. ",1
"Why are you the only bank who won’t allow me to apply for a credit card using my employee contract as evidence of income?

"I wanted to upgrade my Discovery account but was told that I had to close my account first as I had a prepaid Gold account as migrated from FNB, then I could reapply to get and upgraded account. Which I now did and I am getting declined?? After checking all my ITC profiles I realized that DB uses Experian, which is the most useless of them all! They never update information and they are so insufficient. Both my Compuscan and Transunion profiles reflect great scores and perfect info as I check them regularly. Now I am sitting with no Discovery Credit Card and I have Medical, Insurance & Vitality with Discovery, a loyal customer that means nothing for them!",2
I rented a car on 26 november and paid a deposit to avis with my discovery card. I have been trying 5o get my deposit back but between avis saying discovery has the funds and discovery saying avis haven't given them anything I am lost as to what it is I need to do to get my funds back. I spoke to discovery today who now says there was never a payment. Thank god for the sms notification that I could use as proof. If it wasn't for that they would argue that there never was a payment. Even though there are previous requests from their own bankers to release the funds. Why would they do that if there was no payment. Just give me my money back ASAP. ,1
"I am very disappointed with the response from Discovery Bank to process a refund transaction from a merchant on my credit card account. 

I first called on spoke with Thato on 30 Dec (Ref: **********).
I then called and spoke with Tshire on 5th Jan. He was the only consultant to call me back and confirm that the proof of refund documents were received by Discovery Bank.
I then called and spoke with Khanyisile on 11 Jan (Ref: **********)
I today called and spoke with Pamela (Ref: **********).

I cannot believe that this will be the type of service i receive from Discovery Bank for a simple refund from a merchant.

Can someone at Discovery Bank who knows what needs to be done please get a hold of this situation and resolve it urgently.

"Today, after several calls and emails to Discovery Bank, I received an email saying they would help me with my request (close account because they cannot replace my stolen card).

It happens that the email asked me to take same steps that I am saying for the last 30 days that does not work and gives an error message in the system.

It is incredible how Discovery Bank is a failure from technical perspective as they cannot handle the clients they already have in the bank and their system is broken, and also is a failure on the organizational side as the employees don't talk to each other, there are a lot of miscommunication and they have no idea other teams that could help on this.",1
"For years I have been with Discovery medical aid , had  a platinum Discovery card as well as a Motorcard. With the forced migration of these to Discovery Bank , I was issued with a new Discovery Card. I was NOT informed of the UNILATERAL cancellation of my Motorcard which was always my insurance policy in the event of a roadside breakdown. When we experienced a breakdown earlier this month, it took two hours of exceptionally frustrating calls, only to discover that the card had been cancelled. A tow in cost R1600...Very unimpressive service.",1
"For a year and a half now I've been trying to open a bank account and keep getting errors or a message that my application was already submitted. I went through to discovery because the one error was that my ID couldn't be verified. I then went to the home affairs at the Discovery building where they told me there was no problem with my ID verification. Discovery then told me to try later on the app and it will work. It didn't. Since then I've been told several times I can only register on the app, and every time I try I keep getting an error. Last week I was on the phone almost every day with several discovery people telling me different things on how to get it to work, or not knowing at all why it wasn't working. None of the solutions worked. I had two discovery agents promise they'd get back to me and I did get two missed calls when I was in a meeting, and so I called back the number and spent almost 15 minutes on the phone trying to figure out who called me, just to be told it's impossible for them to know who called me. I also didn't receive any message or email so have no idea who called me which is a major ball ache as since Wednesday no-one has tried to get hold of me again and I'm certain no-one will, which means I now have to go through the process of getting hold of them again and getting promises they will call me back and hold fingers crossed that when they do call me back I won't be busy or in a meeting, otherwise I will need to repeat the process AGAIN!!!!!",1

Dear Sir ( office of the CEO) please see all my reviews and ask serious questions as to why such a big and  reputable company is unable to resolve such a small issue since from early last year. 
Looking forward to your response and thanking you in advance for your assistance in this regard  ",1

"Sep 14 '20 to Jan 12 '21... about FOUR months, more than FORTY emails, several 'reminders' after almost every single email, huge waste of time for me [and for Discovery Bank!!??]  

The ""old"" Discovery Platinum is now the new Discovery Bank ""Lead"".  
Platinum means nothing!

There isn't even a person to escalate problems to 
[request/s for escalation within the call center are ignored]

Finally, I was referred to the Discovery Bank Purple Relationship Banker, Chenise Naidoo. That was four months ago and my emails are still ignored without my sending multiple reminders.

Then Ms. Naidoo - at the end of last year - ""DELEGATED"" the matter to Andrew Morgan. That of course is not my concern unless she's delegating responsibility.
Delegating the work [as opposed to responsibility] is not a problem.
If she's delegating responsibility, that is a problem... especially after four months.

PS       nothing heard from ""Andrew Morgan"" ever!

Really disappointing that Discovery's culture [whether the bank, medical, life ins...] has dropped so sharply in a relatively short period of time.

On the 1st of January I received a payment of R50 000 from one of my business partners coming from Nedbank. It was later discover that Nedbank called discovery to report the transaction as suspicious. Discovery has since blocked my account and even after numerous attempts to have this fix they have refused. I have provided the bank with all proof of transactions dating from the day the account was opened what's more irritating is that on the 28th of December I made a Avis car rental wherein they hold a deposit upon returning the car Avis has since refunded my account to the tune of R6900 discovery is refusing to give me access to my money. This is really inconvenient especially in such trying economical times. ,1
"Hey Discovery Bank,
Do you actually want customers? So I've been trying to upgrade my Discovery Bank from Gold to Black. Well, first time in my life I want to give a firm money and they decline it!! I was told that people with no prior credit limit with the company are not eligible to get a credit card at this point. And your consultant can't tell me when this will be possible. Seriously?? Funny since your consultant told me to get the Gold Card as a bridge to get the credit card. I meet all the criteria (salary, etc.) and also have my medical aid and car insurance with Discovery. Please urgently assist or will just have to close it down. No point for me to pay fees for nothing!
Looking forward to being professionally assisted!  ",1

I AM SURE MOST PEOPLE WOULD GET FRUSTRATED AND GIVE-UP, SUCH A GREAT BUSINESS STRATEGY, WAY TO ON BUILDING CUSTOMER TRUST, ESPECIALLY WHEN THERE ARE NO BANKING BRANCHES TO GO TO, TO SPEAK TO SOMEONE REASONABLE ABOUT THE ISSUES, BECAUSE THEN YOU WOULD BE ABLE TO DISCUSS WHY I SHOULD NOT HAVE BEEN CHARGED AND TO RECEIVE A CREDIT BEFORE WALKING OUT THE BANK.

I WISH THAT I ONLY HAD ONE QUERY, HOWEVER THEY ARE MANY, WHICH MEANS THAT WHAT ARE MY CHANCES OF RESOLVING THEM?

HERE ARE SOME OF MY ISSUES:
1) REF: **********
    (PHONED:  18TH NOVEMBER 2020 /  9TH DECEMBER 2020  / 14TH DECEMBER  2020)
13 NOVEMBER – ECCESS INTEREST CHARGED R 0.01
IF MY ACCOUNT CLOSING ON 13 OCTOBER WAS NOT OVER LIMIT WHEN IT CLOSED AND IF THE EXCESS-INTEREST IS CHARGED IN THE FOLLOWING MONTH AS YOU HAVE SUGGESTED, THEN WHY DID YOU CHARGE ME AN EXCESS-INTEREST FEE IN THE NOVEMBER ACCOUNT? 

HOW CAN YOU CHARGE AN EXCESS FEE IF I WAS NOT OVER MY CREDIT LIMIT ???

2)  REF: **********
     R 165.96 INTEREST - CHARGED ON 13 DECEMBER.
    (PHONED:  14TH DECEMBER   2020)

FIRSTLY, HOW CAN YOU CHARGE ME INTEREST, WHEN I PAID OFF MY ACCOUNT, IN FULL ON THE 9TH DECEMBER, WHICH IS BEFORE THE ACCOUNTS CLOSED ON THE 13TH DECEMBER. DO YOU NOT KNOW THE TERMS AND CONDITIONS OF YOUR OWN CREDIT CARD THAT IS ON YOUR OWN WEBSITE THAT STATES THAT IF THE FULL AMOUNT IS PAID, BEFORE THE ACCOUNT CLOSES THAT INTEREST WOULD NOT BE CHARGED. 

(REFER TO PAGE 13 AND PARAGRAPH 37 OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS ON WEBSITE)

     R 17.50 CREDIT SERVICE FEE - CHARGED ON 13 DECEMBER. 
ALSO IN THE TERMS AND CONDITIONS  IT SAYS THAT IF YOU PAY OFF THE CREDIT CARD BUT WISH TO KEEP THE ACCOUNT OPEN AND ACTIVE, THAT I WOULD BE CHARGED THE MONTHLY ACCOUNT FEE ONLY, NOT THE CREDIT SERVICE FEE TOO?
(REFER TO PAGE 7 AND PARAGRAPH 60 OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS ON WEBSITE)

… AND TO MAKE THE MATTER WORSE, I HAVE STILL GOT TO GET A CREDIT FOR THIS BECAUSE WHEN I SPOKE TO A MANAGER, NAMED LULU, SHE DIDN'T SEE AN ISSUE WITH ANY OF THESE CHARGES ???? HOW CAN YOU BE A MANAGER, IF YOU DON'T HAVE A FINANCIAL QUALIFICATION, OR AT LEAST KNOW YOUR OWN TERMS AND CONDITIONS ????

3)  REF: **********
     R 84.50 - 12 JUNE - BRANCH FEE. 
    (PHONED:  17TH DECEMBER   2020)

IN-CORRECTLY CHARGED, IT SHOULD HAVE BEEN AN FNB ATM WITH-DRAWL FEE, FOR R 50.00 WITH-DRAWL. I NEVER GO INTO A BRANCH TO WITHDRAW MONEY AND IT WAS DURING LOCK-DOWN WHEN THE BRANCHES WERE CLOSED?

"By far the worst banking experience I've had in all my life. I applied for an account last year and was assured the card will be sent to me within a few days, to date, nothing. When I phoned the courier, they advised that Discovery made a mistake on my card and need to correct with them, which I tried, but difficult to get through. I have been waiting for my card and to use my account, but in the meanwhile Discovery charged me R188 for nothing (I am now in arrears without even having the card yet). Is this a sign of things to come should I decide to stay with them?",1
"I am so frustrated.
I used to receive, like any other banking system in the country, my Discovery Credit Card statements by email. No worry, no fuss.
Then Discovery Bank was born, and now I am told I have to download the app. When I did so, I was told I must now enter all my details, including my personal income. Seeing as I have had a credit card with Discovery for several years, I do not see the point of filling in all this information.
Why can I not just get what I require?
Then I emailed Discovery, asking for assistance. But now their mailbox is full.
How's that for professional???
I guess I'm going to have to phone them and sit in a waiting queue for ages until they eventually answer my call. How backward is that????",1
"Dear Discovery Bank, 

I don't know how to reach out to you from abroad, since you don't answer any emails, so I will try this way. 

For the second month in a row now, you have tried to take an instalment of R27k from my transactional account to my credit card account. Last month when this happened, I asked you to call me to explain this. I even emailed. Your consultant never came back to me. 

Why on earth would you want to take such a huge installment? I am living and working abroad, and the credit card money will be paid back in full when I am financially stable again. I can agree on a monthly repayment amount, but I don't have R27k all at once at this stage. 

Please do your job and be professional and call me, or at least provide an international email address so that I can email you. 

I am disappointed about your poor service and slow response.

"Ever since the Discovery Credit Card moved away from FNB (when Discovery started their own bank) the service received on this credit card is absolutely THE worst! It was so much easier to manage my card when still linked to FNB. 
I cannot seem to log in to the online banking to manage my card, I cannot log in to the app they want you to download. I struggle to make online purchases, it says the card number is not valid, but everything is correct on my side. Their back end systems seem to be atrocious- they have my husband's ID number linked to my card for some reason, I have been trying all morning to access my credit card details, have phoned the call centre- to absolutely no avail. 

It is so un-user friendly and difficult to use, I wish I could just close this card and never look back! If you don't have an account with them, do yourself a favour and stay away! ",1
"Discovery Bank is BY FAR the worst bank on the continent!! SO glad I'm NOT a client and will never be.

My husband is a client. Somehow they have my phone number on his profile. That means I get all the communication. He tried numerous times to change that without any success. After so many attempts they said they would phone him when we're together to change that since I will get the OTPs. Still not sorted. 

I can only shake my head in shock.

Discovery Bank, do NOT reply to apologise or ask he must contact you. I'm not your messenger and I don't need your empty apology. 
Just GET YOUR ACT TOGETHER and deliver the service you actually charge people for.",1
I am trying to open an investment account. It is such a complicated and convoluted process - not user friendly at all. I also have dialed their number a few times per day on a few days - I enter my ID # as requested - then nothing happens. I am wasting time. I also submit documents - only to get messages to submit those same docs again - and again .....  I also think it is ridiculous for a bank to only do banking on a phone or tablet - I certainly prefer my large monitors coupled to my laptop.,1
"Selfie does not match wat we have on system.

I am going to close my discovery bank account.

No one is able to assist.",1
"Trying to close my account because no one is able to generate a card to me. How can I have a bank but not a card?

I tried o close the account and the system is throwing an error. 

Tried to call the support, but they were not able to close the account too, and they have no idea the reasons for that or how to fix it.

It is a real shame the support and the system used by Discovery Bank.",1
DISCOVERY BANK IS REFUSING TO CREDIT R1000'S DISCOVERY MILES OWED TO ME SINCE AUGUST 2020 - NOBODY IS GETTING BACK TO ME - NOBODY IS ASSISTING ME - I CAN'T GET IN TOUCH WITH MANAGEMENT - IS THERE ANYONE ON HELLO PETER THAT KNOWS HOW I CAN GET THIS SORTED OR HOW TO GET HOLD OF SOMEONE THAT CAN HELP ME CLSOE THIS ACCOUNT?,1
"DO NOT OPEN AN ACCOUNT WITH DISCOVERY BANK

My uncle was just told that him being tied up by thieves with a gun to his sons head is not a good enough reason to give out an atm pin and because the correct pin was used at the atm they cannot refund the money?????? 

He was tied up and locked in the house for over an hour, he was with police members and security men who have OFFERED to do an affidavit stating they were with him when the money was withdrawn and they are NOT INTERESTED!!!! 

Don’t waste your time, their fraud department sucks, I’ve had my own issues with their fraud department and for this reason I and my entire family & friends will be cancelling our discovery bank accounts! 

Rather stick to banks who care about the well-being of their customers. ",1
"As an existing Discovery client( of several products/services might I add) I opted to add a fixed account to my portfolio as well. I downloaded the Discovery app and completed the application. I then receive an email notifying me to upload the relevant documents, which I did, only to then  receive a response informing me that the Utility bill I submitted is not in my name....like really, clearly someone cannot read. Discovery claims one can open an account in 60 seconds via the App, it has been a week already and still no resolution. Endless calls to them and the line goes silent....Looks like I have to approach FNB instead!!!!!",1
"Terrible service but unfortunately, all these banks are the same. App is awful, avoid!!",2
"After my previous compliant about Discovery Bank I received a call from an individual from Discovery stating that the matter will be sorted out. But I am still getting SMS notifications for Mr M J####b detailing all his transactions/purchases. He has a Discovery Bank credit card and I do not have any accounts with Discovery Bank. To make matters worse Mr M J####b is a colleague of mine. I know all of his spending history, where he is spending his money, how much he owes on his credit card and what his movements are based on his transactions. Discovery Bank are disclosing his personal information to me (a 3rd party) without his permission. I have informed him of this numerous times and he has called Discovery Bank to rectify this. Surely this is a breach of the POPI  Act. It makes you wonder what controls Discovery Bank has in place or how secure the IT systems are and how many other clients information is being disclosed to 3rd parties without their permission. I was actually thinking of moving across to Discovery Bank but after this I will never even consider it and I would even discourage people from moving across. ",1

"On my third day after my application for a simple credit card I still get notifications that I have to upload the same documents I have previously uploaded. After talking with the call centre three times, all they can tell me is that my application is under investigation. They can't tell me what is wrong, and also refuse to find out what information is needed to complete my application. Really bad experience to be honest. ",1
"Had Discovery Credit Card for many years and was very happy with the service but not going to be forced to belong to a bank whose principles I don't agree with. However trying to cancel with this Bank is very difficult as there appears to be only one email address whose inbox is full!!?? I ex-country in a remote area for quite a while and can't phone. I hate doing business by phone anyway as there is no record - can you imagine a bank without email addresses?? And also quite strange that in my quest to cancel this unrequested account I hope to make contact with the Bank via Hello Peter as I can't do so through it's own structures .... Anybody from Discovery reading this, my name is ED Beesley - please cancel my business with you ASAP",1
"I’m really struggling to log into the app. I log in and get a screen that says capture income. No matter what info I put in there I cannot get any further, I only get a “no change offers found” screen and the I cannot do anything further.

"Since lockdown, I have been phoning and e-mail Discovery Bank to get relief due to covid pandemic and me not being able to earn any income as I do Airbnb.  I eventually spoke to a supervisor (Kaylin Frazenburg ) who I sent all the relevant e-mails and she would get back to me soon...  This was in October, I am still waiting for her phone call!  Since then I have been handed over to an attorney because I am now behind on my payments.  I have proof of many e-mails and none of them gets answered!  I have now been blacklisted as well!!",1
"I had three bank accounts in South Africa. My experience with this one has by far been the worst.

I moved to Germany in October last year. I kept my Discovery Bank account active initially for emergencies. However, I tried to close it afterwards and the only way to do so is telephonically, and you can't email them to follow up. 

1. There is no e-mail address to contact Discovery Bank on the website. 
2. I was assured by two assistants on the phone that my account would be cancelled, which it was not. I don't understand how this is my fault?
3. I am now being told that I have to pay R2700+ in bank charges for an account that I tried to cancel, that they made near impossible to do.
4. I receive an e-mail at whichever time they feel like responding (could be a week), then get 1-3 days window to pay a specified amount.

"Oct 2019 I called to cancel my Credit Card with Discovery.   At that time I had a credit of +/- R500.00.   I do not have a valid credit card at the moment - there was no renewal of card.   
In Nov 2019 I called again to cancel my card.   Some Call personnel stated that Discovery is taking over the management of the card division. 
I called again when I saw that a fee and interest is charged on this defunct card. 
I called in Sept 2020 and send in copies of all my details and the account that was in credit with one of you agent.    Still no action
Oct 2020 I called again - the called reflected a Durban no.   She again looked into the account and agreed that the credit is due to me and Discovery would reverse all the entries since than.   Nothing happened.
Nov 2020 Spoke to Kagiso Mathumteja - he promised that he would monitor and let me know of the process.  To date no action from Discovery
Dec 2020 I called again because I receive a sms stating that my account is handed over to MBD with a reference no **********.  I called them only to find out that they cannot do anything but I need to pay an outstanding amount.   She was rude and not prepared to listen (Morumisa Carney.  
I cannot understand why must I pay Discovery Card when it was not managed correctly.  Please check if I have a valid credit card first and then make the necessary query.  
How can I pay when I had a credit in my account.??????

"Discovery Bank decided to hand me over to: Due to non-payment on your DISCOVERY BANK account, a Section 129 Legal Notice has been sent. Call MBD on **********. Ref: 300......

This after my monthly account fees have been transferred to my credit card account. None of these accounts were ever in use. The accounts were opened when FNB no longer provided the Discovery Credit Card service. Due to inactivity on both accounts I have consequently requested to have them closed. Bank records would show complete inactivity. Discovery Bank never acted upon these requests and kept accounts open and running up monthly account fees.  Luckily I kept the record of the conversation and date and reference number. 

The exact date which was 8 July to number **********. 

The calls lasted 6:09 and 6:32 respectively where I on both occasions requested final settlement and closure of the accounts.

I have been a Discovery member since 2004. I cannot help but think it was in their interest to keep collecting fees and ignore my request. 

Disgusting behavior from the world's first behavioral bank.

"I’ve had Discovery credit card for years via FNB & it was such a pleasure until Discovery Bank nightmare took over; all my issues started for me in October 2020 when my account migrated to Discovery Bank. The worst bank ever, false advertising on fees, over charging me when I have a quotation of my fees when I joined which is less than what they charge me. I have been trying to get answers from them since November; I have called more than 5 times (45-60 minutes each time) , emailed them proof they needed. Every time I call I have to start the story from the beginning, then promised a 48hr turnaround & a reference number. Now they use underhanded tactics of taking my call & then put me on hold for 30 minutes so that I give up & they hope I will get tired. Think twice before joining , they are disingenuous. I’m done, I’m joining a bank that’s interested in my business. Be warned!!",1
I still have had no answers from anyone or even a phone call from anyone about my frozen accounts. ,1
"I have tried joining the bank since July 2020. 
The first time I tried, it stated that they already had my details, it kept doing this for weeks. I then phoned Discovery Bank & they said they were busy with the application but only to go back & forth for 3 months with this same information, eventually I got my private Financial Advisor involved (who signed me up with discovery medical aid in the first place) & she advised there was a block on my ID & hence by the app kept saying ""there was something wrong with my ID & I would have to go to my nearest home affairs."" 
I then booked an appointment & redid my fingerprints & reapplied for my ID. 
After receiving my ID, i tried again. 
I was told that there is a pending application & technical would have to remove it in order for me to apply, when speaking to technical they said they couldn't find this pending application.... this has happened twice telephonically plus I have sent screenshots of the error it keeps giving me, to date. ""There is something wrong with your ID, visit your nearest Home Affairs"" 
I honestly was so excited when I saw discovery bank launch, thinking it would be simplistic & easy to register & get a credit card in order to benefit from my vitality for an apple watch, yet this wasn't the case & still isn't the case. 
This is honestly the worst banking experience I have ever encountered & I have banked with all the major banks. 
Pity the banking section isn't up to par as the medical aid section.
I would be extremely happy to get this sorted out once & for all because it honestly wastes my time, calling after agents that don't deliver on their ""feedback""",1
"Despite complaining about the card not working for over 3 weeks all I get a reply that says that Discovery Bank has escalated the problem. The card is still not working. I requested feedback by phone but this is too much trouble. It is clear that Discovery Bank does not care about their poor customer experiences ,as they have not resolved the issue or answered my questions. 
I will be left no option but to phone the MD Barry of Discovery bank. It is a sad day to have to escalate a problem to this level to try and get a card properly activated.",1
"Nobody has contacted me regarding an investment that i want to.do with discovery. If you dont want my business then falsely asvertise that yourll can investments speedy and easily 
Absolutely disappointing ",1
"I have had a Discovery Credit Card since it was first launched. When it was administed by FNB I had no complaints. Since Discovery bank administered it, my debit orders take 7 days to clear. What is the point of having a credit card if it takes that long to clear. If Fnb could clear debit orders within 24-48 hours why does Discovery Bank take 7 days to clear? My debit order went off on Monday 21 Dec and after I made a call today I got an email stating that my debit order will only clear on Monday 28 December. I called again today @16:19 to speak to a manager but after waiting 20 mins on my cell I realised Discovery does not value my business. If you cannot clear debit orders within 24-48 hours I might as well find another credit card. This is third world administration for a company that to suppose to be a  market leader. Simply unacceptable Discovery",1
"I'm giving up on this bank. 
Endless problems with trying to retrieve a payment that went to the old FNB account.  Continual problems with certain car hire companies that will not accept the card.  Frustrating wait to get authorisation for larger withdrawals. 
Call centre helpers are always friendly but afterwards nothing gets done.  ",1
"My app stopped working on Saturday 12 December. The error is that there is a technical fault. I should check my Internet connection and try again later. It is not my Internet connection, I am on 50MB Fibre and use the same phone for many other Internet based apps. I have reinstalled the app, restarted my phone and even installed it on another phone still with the same error. The Discovery Technical team yet maintain it is my Internet. I can use the online version but it only offers me read ability. It is too limited as I can't make any payments. I have basically stopped using Discovery Bank since this happened.",1
"Poor service and a credit card which only works for online transactions, in store transactions are declined. This has been going on for over a month with numerous calls and emails. To speak to a human takes about 4 minutes after navigating the call centre maze. *********** - if you send them an email, don’t hold your breath for a reply, when the reply comes back it is obviously unsigned.

Overall, dealing with this bank is like ‘Waiting for Godot’. I’m actually still waiting, am I a fool?",1
"Discovery vitality (discovery bank) are robbing their paying customers. If you are not locked into the discovery eco system then look elsewhere. They promise rewards of up to 50-75 percent using their discovery bank product. To achieve this you have to spend large amounts on your credit card. When you achieve the discount, the cash back that is paid into your account is always incorrect (short by thousands of rands). The spend shows on their system and yet they are unable to resolve the cash back. I have open support tickets with them since July with no resolution. I have asked for a manger call back and they ignore it. Their emails promise 2-5 day turnaround time. You actually end up waiting months. If you follow up with them, they say that the ticket is open and there’s nothing they can do. ",1

"Discovery Bank took over my Discovery Card (credit card) mid-year 2020.
I have a statement indicating I owe them R11,000.
My Discovery Card had its entire month-end balance automatically debited to my Private Bank account and thus always was 100% paid up.
Since they migrated me they cameup with an amount of R11,000 yet I cannot pull a trail of all my past transaction because I can no longer view on my online banking.
I have asked them for the statements and they just never provide them.
I fear as a small guy VS such an entity I have no chance because this in my opinion is tantamount to a scam and or poor management. I have tried to get help of a senior management member. Its probably easier for me to contact by email the entire cabinet of ministers in our government.

"On 12 November 2020 I posted my disappointment with Discovery Bank for failing to deliver on a promise of a R1,000.00 Woolworths voucher in return for my upgrading my credit card to Discovery Bank card. The next day, Discovery responded by saying that they were in the process of issuing vouchers and would revert. 
It is now SIX WEEKS LATER! and I have neither received the voucher nor had any other feedback from Discovery. With this kind of poor service, I fail to see a promising future for Discovery Bank",1
"On Thursday the 17th of December i had contacted discovery to request assistance in signing and Stamping a (Z56) government form, so that my Salary can be paid into my Discovery Bank account. I had spoken to a Chanty, whom assured me that this process will be expedited within 10-30mins. I was chaffed as the process is rather quite simple 25mins process for any another bank and was confident that I would not be disappointed.  

I signed the relevant documents and emailed  them to ***********  on the 18th December 2020, at 1:07pm. The first consultant Chanty had provided me with this email address. Within Minutes I received a automated reply.

On Monday the 21 December 2020, I had yet to receive any reply from Discovery. I decided to call once again, and a consultant whose name I had forgotten assured me that she will email the document to me with 10 mins, and apologies for this error. 

After an hour and a half, I received no further communication from Discovery. Perplexed, I contacted them again, and spoke to a Zikhona (call reference 3014- 653). After telling Zikhona my story, she quested an opportunity to investigate the matter. Upon her return, A rather smug Zikhona informed me that the process takes 24 working hours (That I must not include weekends, and Public holidays) to sign and return the Z56. She further told me that Discovery Bank only had one individual responsible for the signing of these documents, and that I should wait until they get to my document. 

Outside of Zikhona’s appalling attitude, I was confused why no other consultant had informed me of this 24-hour window. I further asked her why only one manager was available to sign and stamp documents, and how I, as discovery, which proports itself as a bank could offer such a bad service. 

I had already made concessions that to my Human Resources department that I would submit this form based on the correspondence I had received from two consultants I had discussed the matter with. Zikhona, continued and emphasized that I should wait for my turn, and that the 24 working cycle is far from its conclusion.

I had to have the matter escalated o the manager. A Mr. Kingsley (call reference : 3015-814)  who graciously informed me  that the process is indeed 24 hours. And that Discovery does not know when my matter will receive the necessary assistance. 

It is truly concerning that Discovery bank, which offers only digital support for its clients, has such a poor operational strategy for its customers. I am sincerely disappointed and would strongly urge anyone considering migrating to this bank to reconsider. My experience has taught me better.

"I got my new Discovery Credit Card delivered today, however Discovery Bank fails to activate it online. After many attempts online I phoned and spoke to their support person but according to her nothing can be done to rectify this.

"WELL DONE DISCOVERY BANK - FOR HIRING ALL THE STUPID PEOPLE!!!

SUCH A GREAT IDEA, SO THAT ANYONE WHO PHONES IN WITH ANY COMPLAINTS, NO ONE WHO YOU SPEAK TO, WHICH INCLUDES CUSTOMER SERVICE PERSONAL, ESCALATION DEPARTMENT, MANAGER, AND ""THE SUPPOSED KNOW IT ALL - PRODUCT DEPARTMENT"" UNDERSTANDS A SIMPLE EXCESS FEE QUERY, WHICH MEANS THAT NOTHING GETS RESOLVED, BECAUSE AFTER THREE PHONE-CALLS, SPENDING ALMOST 2 HOURS HOLDING ON THE PHONE, AND BEING PROMISED A PHONE-CALL BY THE END OF THE DAY, WHO IN THEIR 
RIGHT-MIND WOULD EVER CARE IF THERE ISSUE IS EVER RESOLVED? 

I AM SURE MOST PEOPLE WOULD GET FRUSTRATED AND GIVE-UP, SUCH A GREAT BUSINESS STRATEGY, WAY TO ON BUILDING CUSTOMER TRUST, ESPECIALLY WHEN THERE ARE NO BANKING BRANCHES TO GO TO, TO SPEAK TO SOMEONE REASONABLE ABOUT THE ISSUES, BECAUSE THEN YOU WOULD BE ABLE TO DISCUSS WHY I SHOULD NOT HAVE BEEN CHARGED AND TO RECEIVE A CREDIT BEFORE WALKING OUT THE BANK.

I WISH THAT I ONLY HAD ONE QUERY, HOWEVER THEY ARE MANY, WHICH MEANS THAT WHAT ARE MY CHANCES OF RESOLVING THEM?

HERE ARE SOME OF MY ISSUES:

1) REF: **********
    R 2.30 EXCESS FEE - CHARGED ON 13 OCTOBER. HOW CAN YOU CHARGE AN
    EXCESS FEE IF I WAS NOT OVER MY CREDIT LIMIT? SINCE I OPENED MY 
    CREDIT CARD IN 2007, I HAVE ONLY EVER BEEN CHARGED AN OVER-LIMIT OR      
    EXCESS FEE IN THE SAME MONTH THAT IT WAS OVER, SO YOUR ""SUPPOSED 
    KNOW IT ALL PRODUCT DEPARTMENT"" TO COMEBACK AND SUGGEST THAT IT 
    WAS FROM THE PREVIOUS MONTH OF SEPTEMBER, IS A POOR EXCUSE. 
    ESPECIALLY BECAUSE, I KNOW THAT I WAS OVER-LIMIT IN SEPTEMBER, BUT I 
    ALREADY PAID R 3.12 ON 13 SEPTEMBER, SO I DON'T KNOW HOW THEY CAN 
    EVEN SUGGEST THIS AS CASE CLOSED, SURELY THEY WOULD HAVE CHECKED 
    MY SEPTEMBER STATEMENT TO SEE THAT I DID IN-FACT PAY IT BEFORE THEY 
    MADE A STUPID ASSESSMENT???? I AM STILL BELIEVE IT OR NOT FIGHTING 
    THIS ISSUE EVEN THOUGH ANYONE WITH HALF A BRAIN WOULD HAVE 
    REFUNDED THE MONEY?

2)  REF: **********
     R 165.96 INTEREST - CHARGED ON 13 DECEMBER. FIRSTLY, HOW CAN YOU 
     CHARGE ME INTEREST, WHEN I PAID OFF MY ACCOUNT, IN FULL ON THE 9TH 
     DECEMBER, WHICH IS BEFORE THE ACCOUNTS CLOSE. DO YOU NOT KNOW 
     THE TERMS AND CONDITIONS OF YOUR OWN CREDIT CARD THAT IS ON YOUR 
     OWN WEBSITE THAT STATES THAT IF THE FULL AMOUNT IS PAID, BEFORE THE 
     ACCOUNT CLOSES THAT INTEREST WOULD NOT BE ADDED.

     R 2.15 EXCESS FEE - CHARGED ON 13 DECEMBER. AGAIN I WAS CHARGED THIS    
     FEE EVEN THOUGH I WAS NOT OVER THE LIMIT, I HAD IN FACT NOT EVEN 
     USED THE CREDIT CARD FOR A WHOLE MONTH SINCE NOVEMBER AND I PAID 
     IT OFF ON THE 9TH DECEMBER, WHICH MEANS THAT THE ACCOUNT BALANCE 
     WAS R 0.00 WHEN THE ACCOUNT CLOSED. CERTAINLY YOU CAN NOT 
     WARRANT AN OVER-CHARGE THEN???

     R 17.50 CREDIT SERVICE FEE - CHARGED ON 13 DECEMBER. ALSO IN THE 
     TERMS AND CONDITIONS, IT SAYS THAT IF YOU PAY OFF THE CREDIT CARD 
     BUT WISH TO KEEP THE ACCOUNT OPEN TO THAT I WOULD BE CHARGED THE 
     MONTHLY ACCOUNT FEE ONLY, NOT THE CREDIT SERVICE FEE TOO?

     AND TO MAKE THE MATTER WORSE, I HAVE STILL GOT TO GET A CREDIT FOR 
     THIS BECAUSE WHEN I SPOKE TO A MANAGER, NAMED LULU, SHE DIDN'T SEE 
     AN ISSUE WITH ANY OF THESE CHARGES???? HOW CAN YOU BE A MANAGER, 
     IF YOU DON'T HAVE A FINANCIAL QUALIFICATION, OR AT LEAST KNOW YOUR
     OWN TERMS AND CONDITIONS????

3)  REF: **********
     R 84.50 - 12 JUNE - BRANCH FEE. IN-CORRECTLY CHARGED, IT SHOULD HAVE 
     BEEN AN FNB ATM WITH-DRAWL FEE, FOR R 50.00 WITH-DRAWL. I NEVER GO 
     INTO A BRANCH TO WITHDRAW MONEY?

"Discovery Bank - HORROR - WHAT A NIGHTMARE

Query still not resolved.. Going into the 5th month..

There is an employee called AJ, he replies to posts here and does nothing! His last response - on Monday was that he is finding out why I have not been contacted! This has been my experience with Discovery bank since September.. With employees such as AJ - who just responds to these post and does nothing - this bank would never have a chance.

Discovery bank is a no no. I am regretting being a client of such a disorganised bank. The customer service is a shock - and the escalation process does not work. No matter what you do - you will not get your query resolved. I have had a query since September 2020, whereby they duplicated transactions - and I have spent a lot of money calling them to get this resolved.. they never call you back - and when you call - after staying on hold for close to an hour - sometimes longer - they give you one excuse or the other - and the queries never ever get resolved. References - ********** and **********.  If you do not want stress in your life - stay away from this atrocious organisation. With all the resources they are putting into marketing the bank - the customer service is disheartening to say the least.. a disaster! My advice - stay away from this disaster of a bank.  Over 3 months later - my query is still not resolved - and I have spend close to R500 on calls - for them to resolve a fault they caused. Stay away from this nightmare of a bank - they have no clue what they are doing. Thank me later.",1

"Having daily payment limits are commonplace in the banking world.  Where Discovery Bank fails is to respond in reasonable time to raise such limit upon request.

We're a little stuck.


in my opinion Discovery Bank should take their credit cards and shove it so far up their collective ****s that hopefully the cards will fill the emtpy void they (Discovery Bank staff) have in their heads as they obviously never thought this through.

(migrating to a new bank - VISA verification - OTP sent to south african numbers only - roaming is enabled - STILL don;t receive any OTP's from Discovery+ no way to chnage the OTP destination



*&*^&* idiots.

"Very disappointed by Discovery Bank. On the 10th of November I received a notification of a transaction in dollars. I immediately notified Discovery of the fraudulent transaction and they canceled my card. However they do not want to reverse the transaction as the vendor has provided ""compelling evidence "" that I authorized the transaction. Their so-called compelling evidence includes the name and email address of a total stranger living in the US. I would love to know how they got their hands on my card details and also how the OTP system was bypassed.  I always have to provide an OTP with online transactions and for the fraudulent transaction one was never received. I no longer feel safe banking with Discovery and will be canceling my account.  I would advise people twice when shopping online with a Discovery card. I have had a Discovery card for years and while FNB managed it there were no issues whatsoever ",1
"Still cannot open a savings account for my mum after a month. 
FICA department continues to insist on a passport or driving license from her when she doesn't have one. 
Her ID was submitted numerous times via the app and email.
Call centre is clueless.  Spoke to a manager Daphne whom I cannot get ahold of as the call centre staff are clueless. 
She promised to sort the matter out once and for all yesterday and I haven't recieved feedback from her as yet. 
Stay far away from this bank.  It's such a pain trying to open a savings account,  I don't want to imagine or put myself through the stress of a cheque or credit card!",1
"When using my Discovery miles to pay for an order on Takelot the transaction timed out and the order was not paid for however my Discovery miles were reduced. I reported this to discovery via their website on the 6/12/2020, I followed up telphonically on 10/12/2020 and to date I have not been refunded my discovery miles.  Pretty poor service in my opinion.",1
"Thanks for your reply, the card has been reset a few times and yesterday afternoon she tried to go shopping. This is the 4th or 5th time the card has been rejected after following the instructions from the call center operators who has given us different instructions every time.  It appears that the training is poor of your call center as there is no consistent answer . We are not resolving the problem but every day she is told to check the Nedbank ATM for balances which then says card invalid. 
We are being seriously inconvenienced as no solution is coming forward. You did not respond on the FICA issue that caused this card to be out of action for so long.
I will request once again for my wife to try the card , can some one phone me as we are going away on holiday on Friday. When was this card reset",1
I see you have changed the banking access and now i cannot access any details of my credit card including stopping a lost card. this serves to inform you my card is lost. please conatct me,1
Who can assist in getting my account closed? No way of contacting you. If I phone I need to hold for longer than 30min with still no answer. When requesting a callback it never happens. I'm just paying for a service that is non existed. Please can this be sorted as soon as possible. ,1
"It's strange how you only see the positive reviews from Hellopeter on Discovery Bank's website but their overall rating on Hellopeter itself is dismal. The transition to Discovery Bank has been anything but smooth. The consultants I have spoken to have extremely poor product knowledge and can almost never answer a question immediately. I logged a query with their call centre in May 2020 and I still don't have a response! Their app is also not user friendly as they don't seem to think of different scenarios - just the ONE scenario in their minds, which means it often doesn't work when you want to do something different. They also force all their useless products onto me and charge me for it even though I've proven to them that their product doesn't benefit me. Seems they don't care about benefitting me - just that the product benefits them in some way! They really are a disgrace to digital banking or any bank actually in 2020! ",1
"Discovery Bank - APPALLING- What an embrassment

Query still not resolved. No one has contacted me despite some ""AJ"" having promised.

Discovery bank is a no no. I am regretting being a client of such a disorganised bank. The customer service is a shock - and the escalation process does not work. No matter what you do - you will not get your query resolved. I have had a query since September 2020, whereby they duplicated transactions - and I have spent a lot of money calling them to get this resolved.. they never call you back - and when you call - after staying on hold for close to an hour - sometimes longer - they give you one excuse or the other - and the queries never ever get resolved. References - ********** and **********.  If you do not want stress in your life - stay away from this atrocious organisation. With all the resources they are putting into marketing the bank - the customer service is disheartening to say the least.. a disaster! My advice - stay away from this disaster of a bank.  Over 3 months later - my query is still not resolved - and I have spend close to R500 on calls - for them to resolve a fault they caused. Stay away from this nightmare of a bank - they have no clue what they are doing. Thank me later.

"I am the main member of DIscovery Bank. I have a secondary card for my wife. She went shopping and her purchase was denied. I phoned the bank and they advised me this was due to expected Fraud. I phoned the fraud department they said the card was put on hold due to Fica requirements. I wanted to know why the stopped the card with out prior informing her. The told me that an email was sent . I needed to send a certified ID and proof of address. I got the certified ID and then checked the mail that requested a Fica update form to be sent. They never gave a dead line or said that the card would be stopped if this was not updated. I sent in the form. We received no reply or communication from the bank. I checked my Discovery App and found teh card to be activated.

We tried shopping again and it was rejected  again . I have phoned the ban at least on 4 occasions and they have not resolved. The last call yesterday the consultant said that i needed to go to verify my card at a Nedbank ATM and request a balance twice. Theat would reactivate the card. I tried to do so but this request was denied.

I am sick to death of being messed around by your bank with staff taht dont follow up or are able to resolve the issue

"I recently experienced fraud on my Discovery Credit card.    There were a number of transactions totaling +/- R12000.  Both transactions had been made pounds sterling.  I have not traveled overseas or made foreign purchases on this card before.  I contacted Discovery within an hour and was told to submit a fraud form that was sent to me.  One amount was reversed, but an amount for the equivalent of R5K has still not been reversed four days later.  Two days after the event I was contacted by a fraud investigator, by the name of Clive.  He said that they hadn't received the requisite form, although I had received an electronic acknowledgement of receipt two days before.  He said he would follow up; he didn't.  I had to follow up  and discovered that no further progress had been made.  Not only did Discovery's fraud prevention systems not work, but their responsiveness to me the customer and the victim of their failed systems has been very poor, to say the least.  The Discovery brand is so full of swagger and self-regard, which I could tolerate if there service wasn't so pathetic.  ",1
"A month and a half ago I received an sms notifying me that my Discovery Credit Card functionality has been locked and they would send me further information via email. The email never came. My card keeps getting declined when I try to use it. I have phoned the helpline only to be kept on hold without anyone ever ansswering. I just was placed on hold for 65 minutes waiting on your Discovery Bank helpline for a maneger. I have contacted them via Facebook twice as well to which they reply that they have escalated the case, I never receive a call. I have mailed in all my documents, a lady there said she would get right back to me. That never happened. I want out. I want to go back to FNB where I actually got service. How could you ever make it up to me after 6 weeks of no service and no communication. This is the problem with a bank having no physical presence, they cannot be held accountable.",1

"I have been trying to apply for a credit card since August in order to access some of the benefits offered by Discovery Vitality. The bank is able to run a credit check, give a credit limit but can't remove a ""block"" on my ID number. I have been to the DHA and was advised that there is no block on their end. This is only a Discovery Bank issue as no other bank has this issue.",1
I ordered a new bank card last week. It was meant to arrive on Tuesday. Unfortunately the card didn't arrive. I then called and spoke to a gentlemen by the name of Kabelo. He was a fantastic help.

I use this card for business expenses, but if I cannot reconcile, I will have to use something else that can be digitally downloaded and reconcile. I am at the point of cancelling this card.",1

"So Discovery Bank starts deducting premiums for something called ""Vitality Money"" at R30, something which I have not even signed up for.

I have so many issues with this so called 'behavioural bank' that I don't even know where to start. Perhaps this bank should start by having a proper account inquiries platform on their smartphone App where existing clients can get their needs immediately attended to. And how about an email address and a call centre number connecting to people who really care?

"On 24th Nov 2020 Discovery bank sent me an sms saying my account was limited. No details why. I phoned in and found out that my Fica had expired, but instead of notifying me ahead of time, they froze my account and held my money hostage until I sent in FICA docs. They said it might take up to 4 days to be approved and reactivated.

After my Fica was approved and my card was APPARENTLY reactivated, I have had endless problems with using it.

It worked at Dischem but was declined at my hairdresser. It worked at one restaurant but failed at a garden Centre, another restaurant and at Woolies. 

I phoned in to enquire. The first response was that there was nothing wrong with the card, it was a problem with the point of sale system. At FOUR different vendors. I phoned in again and demanded a further investigation. 

Then they finally actually looked at the problem and now tell me the chip on the card is damaged. So its damaged in such a way it works at one shop but not another randomly?

They are now sending me a replacement card. I have now had a non working card for 3 weeks since they froze my account without warning. I see at least one other reviewer seems to have the same problem I do. 

Total disaster show. I'm eagerly awaiting my new FNB card because hopefully I'll have a credit card that actually reliably works when I need it. ",1

"Hi,

To start off with, there is almost no contact information easily available via your website in relation to fraud.

I logged a fraud case on 21 April 2020, I received no response then sent a follow up on 1 June 2020. Now 6 months later I will be sending a 3rd email as I have still not received a response. 

All emails were sent to *********** as this was the only in I could find.

For a bank to not even acknowledge a case being logged or simply not respond to fraud cases is simply unacceptable.

I suppose if the current hellopeter rating and NPS scores are anything to go by, this is common practice for Discovery Bank.",1

After having a discovery credit card for a number of years I moved across to Discovery Bank. The process was seamless but then came the catch - they automatically upped the credit interest rate.

Solution - close the account and don't give them a cent more!,1
I do not bank with them but I constantly get sms notifications for transactions when someone has purchased with their credit card. I initially thought that someone might have opened an account in my name and I called Discovery Bank and they informed me that they do not have any records under my name or ID number. This has been happening for months. Through my own investigation I find out that these transactions belongs to a colleague of mine. I have informed him that Discovery Bank is sending his transactions and confidential information to me and have forwarded him these sms notifications. He has informed me that he has contacted Discovery Bank to enquire why this is happening and that they have his number on the system.

"Recently Discovery Bank was rated the worst bank in South Africa. I wholly endorse this rating ! When Discovery was connected to FNB, their service etc. was fine. When their bank became operational I was FORCED to follow their instructions re the move. Although my FNB account is still active (no problems there), an account for me was instituted by Discovery. During the first few months there was no problem, but when they adopted the policy of changing one's login details every month, major problems rose and their attitude was one of doctrinaire. To change passwords etc every month was a nightmare and totally impractical. Their reasoning was to improve/strengthen security for one's account. It has now become so ridiculous that I can no longer access my account despite numerous efforts to do so, according to their procedures, which are difficult to follow. The PW change they insisted upon automatically affected the login to Discovery Health too (I have been a member there for decades). Their helpline is a disaster and under the current pandemic conditions their staff skills are deplorable. I have had no possibility to access my bank account for almost a month now despite talking to their Digital Support dept. and their OTP (One Time Pin) dept. (the OTP is needed each time specific details are changed, e.g. PW's, Username, phone numbers etc). Each time I have asked to be put through to a senior person, excuses are made re their availability. I am continuously told that I will receive a call back, I'm still waiting. It's easier to get through to President Ramaphosa than to get to top level management at Discovery. Since this stupid policy of theirs, their customer service has gone. Their ability to assist with solving my problem is now simply wishful thinking. Their Banking App (a requirement for using my cell phone to do my banking has been removed. How....I don't know). To get it reactivated I need to access my account and they can't help. I wonder what group of Primates actually work there ! I have now wasted so much time and money to resolve my problem, that I am considering to close the account, but I can't even do that without first being able to access the account. I'm at my wits end with them and I hope that you will be able to help/assist me. Need I say more about the worst bank in South Africa ?

"I have been using Discovery Visa card for a few years. Upon receiving an SMS to pay my balance, I have transferred  $2000 from an oversees account as I have been doing for many years. However, after not getting my money for 8 days, I have tried to contact the bank through a function “call me back” on Discovery app, for at least five times. Nobody has bothered to call me back. I have called them directly  but unfortunately their system is not working properly. The managers don’t have a direct line, call center could not help, blaming their system.  In the end I was told by one of the managers that Discovery no longer accept transfers from oversees since they still did not receive their license. Since I transferred the funds to my usual Discovery card not knowing that the card has been transferred to Discovery bank from First Rand bank, my money is now missing, somewhere between the two banks. My card still states Visa and was never changed to Discovery Bank card.  A few months ago, when I spoke to Discovery consultant, I was told that it is not mandatory to move to Discovery bank. A month ago, I did ask one of their consultants to call me back to discuss this issue but nobody did. Not in any of their communications I was advised that Discovery bank can’t accept transactions from oversees, like it used to be in the past. ",2

I received no other notification from Discovery Bank and could not use my card that day.   On the following day, I called the call centre and was transferred to the fraud department when I was advised that my card had been blocked due to suspected fraud.
I find this matter unacceptable and would like to have urgent feedback as to what transpired.",2

I have been battling since June last year to get my discovery account closed. I paid all outstanding fees and send the form. 
Unfortunately the e-mail address that was given does not work. Discovery has also sent me a email to my daughters e-mail account. When I replied to that email on the same day it came back as not operational.
If you look at Discovery banks website there is no e-mail address!!!!!
I've spoken to various Discovery personnel regarding this matter and everytime I gets told that they will close the account and reverse the fees... but they just continue with adding on additional fees each month.
Im at the end of my thether... this is unacceptable an unprofessional client service.  And now they want to hand me over... ridiculous!!I 
I see there is more than 2600 unhappy replies on hello peter regarding Discovery Banks pathetic and scaly service... how is it possible that they are not being investigated and closed down?

"3 weeks now and still no feedback why my debit order did not go through, but on a daily basis you will get an sms to say that you don't pay and you are in arrears. Stay away from Discovery bank. ",1
No assistance at all!! Trying to get the OTP sorted out; have been phoning for more than a week and each day we are promised that the OTP Dept will call us......surprise surprise no calls!! Can someone please give THIS URGENT attention!!!!! ,1
"Tried numerous times to get the credit card cancelled, they don't do it and expect me to pay the fees.
Tried and tried and they say everything is recorded, but still, they do nothing.  Today, their OTP system didn't work, so the agent asked me questions, ID number, cell number etc, and then tells me I failed verification, so she can't help me. So I ask her to get an agent to call me back - she just says I can't help you.  
Now, i'm getting these texts to say they're going to hand me over to a debt collector - for fees they are charging!!!!!  ",1
"What is happening to the service discovery is so to say striving to give their clients? The service is terrible across all products, and this is putting it lightly! 

Since the 15th September I have been sending e mails back and forth to vitality, and discovery bank rewards regarding my gym cash backs that i did not receive. Only in late October I started to received my cashbacks, but it is promised 5 days after debit order you will get you money back!  Till today i have been sending e mails and phoning numerous times to find out what is going on regarding my gym percentage, and the cash back amount i am receiving back. Still no feedback has been giving, each e mail response after a few days is just empty promises and lies! Your query has been escalated, we will keep you updated and phone you. Till today discovery hasn't phones me once, I am past R300 worth of airtime struggling to get through and speaking to incompetent advisors. Since September when discovery started paying cash backs again as gyms re opened, my gym benefits was at 100% as i am a bank client and have my debit order for gym through discovery bank. Now i am on 75% an no answers can be given? My debit order for virgin active is R530 but i am only getting R477 back each month? still no answers here either? So tell me discovery how many reviews do you guys need to get and social posts with people ranging about your service before you will take action? You strive to be south Africa top Service provider across all field but looking at reviews and social comments its a joke! Don't even give corona the blame with less staff, because corona doe snot cause incompetent staff! IT IS BY CHOICE. Contacted discovery twice on Facebook messenger as my e mails just did not get responded too, ""we do apologies for the delays as this is taking longer that anticipated, this has been sent to our senior analyst for investigation"" as this gets escalated even to this higher departments still no feedback. F***** JOKE! 

All my mails has been sent each time to your complaint department since 15th September not one email or phone call, so why the f*** do you have a complaint department as they are even worse than the rest!  3 months, must be one hell of a score for discovery keeping clients on hold!

"Good day,

I made purchase in last year through Takealot using my discovery miles..the item was faulty and thus returned. Takelot refunded the amount in two transactions to my disovery miles account. Only one of the transactions was refunded on my account..and the other one not. 

It has been 10 months of constant emails and phone calls...each time speaking to someone new, and repeating the story. There is never a manager/senior person available to speak to. 

Firstly Discovery insisted that the refund was made to my account...after sending proof that it was not, I had to get a load of documents from Takelot confirming the refund...and then the refund to my account was promised... This was provided...and no refund...now all of a sudden the discovery claims that the refund was never received from takelot. While takelot insists that the refund was given to Discovery. Neither parties owning up to their responsibility to sort out the mess.

I am tired of having the inquire and ""proof"" my case...Discovery Bank only sends an automated response...and no feedback on the case. Really pathetic virtual bank that is suppose to sort out inquiries via email...as they state ""a banker will contact you soon""...which does not happen..  And takelot stands by their proof that it was returned to Discovery.",1
"I have had an issue with my new credit card because of a Fraud Lock. This has caused numerous transactions to fail, but also at the same time a lot have gone through successfully. Yesterday I spent a lot of the day making phone calls to Discovery to resolve this. It started of well where the first consultant called me back after investigation. Then she promised to call me back at 12 and no call came. I phoned back and the 2nd person promised to get it sorted and I would hear from her or the original consultant. At 5pm no call came so I called again. I was the transferred to the Fraud department and again promised I would be called. A day later and still no call or communication. Please go back and listen to your 3 consultants empty promises. Such a disappointing experience. I guess Discovery doesn’t care enough about my business. I will be forced to use an alternate bank to allow my transactions to go through. Incredibly frustrated and disappointed at this poor service. An indication that I should definitely not consider moving completely over to discovery bank",1
"I am very Disappoint with the service that I have Received from discovery bank, their agents are so unprofessional and getting any information from them is like pulling teeth. I have called in many times to get a transection stopped that has been going of on my account and every time I get excuses. ",1
I have been trying to update my contact details with Discovery since they moved their credit card facility from FNB so that I can login and get details for my various accounts.  No luck whatsoever.  This is beyond pathetic. Best is today I am informed that they can't update details because I am 3 days late on a payment when I made an arrangement to pay on the 20th each month until December 2020 due to C19.  ,2
"Extremely poor customer service, two weeks and my request to close account is not completed. It takes upto 20 minutes of holding for their call centre and still no one is available. Passionate about great customer servive statement is a blatant lie, false adverti*****t actually. ",1
"The website advertise a happy client and approval process within 4 hours. Dont be fooled it takes 2-5 business days per my last chat with them. Just to mention two other consultants previously promissed by lunch and the second by COB the next day. Its now a day later and still not done. I dont mind the time waiting but I hate empty promises.

"Discovery bank and the whole Discovery group are incompetent liars who make promises but don't deliver on them. Worse still, they edit my bank transaction history to tell me the problem has been corrected but it has not.
On the 7th of June, I activated my Apple Watch benefit and paid the R999 on my discovery card. 
On the 7th of September I was once again billed R999 for another Apple Watch benefit. 
After speaking to multiple consultants and emailing all and sundry, the erroneous R999 was credited back to my credit card account without any apology or admission that they were in the wrong - an error that if not spotted would have cost me a grand!
Reference number ********** 

This made me keep a more regular eye on my bank account - especially after activating any future benefits.
 On 26 August, I paid for and activated my shoes booster. I then bought a pair of shoes from Sportsman's warehouse because Vitality Active had a promotional special saying that they're paying double cashbacks until the end of the month in an effort to get South Africa moving again.
The initial cashback was paid to me on 25 September at the end of that particular billing cycle, but only a single portion was paid, not the double cashback as indicated on all marketing materials.
I phoned to query this several times and was bounced around from department to department and then was disconnected without reason (read hung up on) - at least 10 times. 
After not finding success on the phone, I started emailing the company also.
-WRefNo#**********#- -MailRef#**********#- 1 October
-WRefNo#**********#- -MailRef#**********#- 5 October
-WRefNo#**********#- -MailRef#**********#- 21 October
-WRefNo#**********#- -MailRef#**********#- 3 November
-WRefNo#**********#- -MailRef#**********#- 10 November
Reference kept being made to two payments – one on 25 September and the second on 1 October.
The 1 October amount was not yet paid and I was given a range of excuses like it’s being processed, it’s been allocated but not yet released, etc.
I checked my account every couple of days to see what was happening. On 10 November I noticed that my bank transaction history had been edited. They had put a line item saying that my account had been credited with the outstanding 3000 discovery miles. This was in no was true. My balance at the time was only a few hundred miles.

I had taken a screen shot of the period end September to early October to prove to the agent I was in email contact with that no payment had been made and 1 week later, I took a screen shot where the bank tried to sneak it into my account so they could say it was resolved. Whilst a new line item was in the transaction history, the balance of the account did not update at all.

I’ve received two recent emails and one phone call from Discovery to say that they are still working through the problems but nobody is explaining how this illegal practice of editing bank records is allowed to happen.

I have spent hours and hundreds of Rands on the phone being bounced around from one department to another. Each subdivision blames a different one - that's money rewards, this is vitality active rewards, shoe booster benefits department, etc.
Stay away from Discovery if you can. They are the worst bank I’ve ever dealt with.

"They cancelled my credit card because of possible fraud, and were supposed to deliver my new card a week ago. I have not heard from them??",1
"My two issues have still not been dealt with and I await SERVICE, or , is this too much to ask as a customer?

Two Issues:
1) I am unable to get credits passed when returning purchases - phoned your call centre a few weeks ago - was promised feedback - Ignoring YOUR customer is NOT feedback. Tried to return an item today - problem still exists.
2) Received an email offering an account ""colour change"", tried to accept, failed, phoned in, was told to update my app, updated app, problem persists.
Last week I called in, was told the reason was that I have a bad credit record - I ABSOLUTELY DO NOT have a bad credit record, was transferred to credit department to be told I was in the wrong department, held on for feedback, got cut off.
The only reason I may be defined as a bad customer is due to the fact that you levied 3 amounts of interest on my credit card account in March and April due to your own mess up that required 3 calls to get resolved.
Somebody called back promising feedback shortly.
I then received an email claiming that you had tried to call me.
I did not even receive a missed call.
Nobody has bothered to follow up - This seems to be your way of operating which is less than pathetic.
Kindly deliver service to your paying customer.

I await a phone call

I have been trying to close my account but there is no other way than sitting hold for a few hours to speak to a consultant. Which is crazy especially if you're working full-time. Why cant you email queries? I would like to close this account before I get charged exorbitant banking fees for an account that I dont use.,1

"My banking app doesn't work, reported it to Discovery on 22 October, and 3 times afterwards. There is an IT problem that has been escalated 3 times now. Problem is, i can t get my money out unless i go draw cash out. I wont do that. Imagine putting your salary into an account and you cant pay your bills at the end of the month. My money is locked by Discovery, because of their problem. Thieves!!!!",1
I'm having difficulty getting in contact with a Discovery Banker. Calling the helpline you do not have an option for general inquiry. So I'm a client and would like to know what is the difference between Gold and Platinum except for monthly fees being higher? You guys do not even have an email address to send queries to.,2
Discovery Miles STILL do not work for Takelot neither do they work for purchases to Loot. I have tried to phone escalate the issue twice. I have previously put reviews on hello peter. I get replies with apologies but no solution! It has been more than a month now,1

 Each banking consultant promises to do so and it NEVER happens.
Now I am told that they do not have the facility to action my request and I will have to phone in every month to have them reverse the excess fee charged.",1
Well done Mampo. good client service!,5
"As with Richard B's experience, we have blaringly incorrect interest charges on our 2x recent statements. 

Called Discovery, spoke to Bernice, requesting a manager as discussing interest calculations with call centre agents is generally a waste of time. 37 MINUTES after being put on hold by Bernice, I cut the call, as I could conceivably be on hold until 2021.

Called again, spoke to Mpho Masti - after once again being on hold, she said that she would get a manager to call back. Another 16+minutes on the phone.

At this point, still no manager call back. Will probably need to call a 3rd time. Supposedly premium product, seriously appalling customer care.",1
"Hi. Since July/August 2020 I've had no joy getting my queries resolved for Pick n Pay Healthyfood cashbacks i.e. for June & July 2020 purchases (missing Pick n Pay transactions on your system, yet I provided till slips thereof), September and October 2020 purchases (NO Vitality Health portion received at all, ie 25%, only the Vitality Money portion received which is a small % portion in comparison). I should have never upgraded from Discovery Card to Discovery Bank. At least then, I received all my cashbacks due to me, i.e. the full Vitality Health portion of 25%. You are full of promises but can't deliver. Your Systems Team are always investigating according to your Bank Rewards Team, but nothing becomes of it. That's if your query doesn't go into a black hole somewhere and they respond back. I've had to re-send new queries and start the process again,  when it does appear to have gone into a black hole. Also your Bank Rewards Team lack skills/knowlege/training in their responses,very generic answers and/or dont make sense. I think I've been more than patient now. I've also never been able to get through to a Bank Rewards agent telephonically, when put through to them either. Definitely gona take this matter further if there's no outcome soon.

Indeed, today I received an email from Mr Thabang Mkwa**** indicating that I has not any knowledge of this matter, which has been dragging on for all this time. People should be very careful before trusting this company to live up to the client service they promise. ",1
Does it really takes weeks to identify where did the money disappeared when refund from the CC merchant have done the refund successfully ?? What is the benefit of having sophisticated systems when it doesn't make business process seamless and smooth. The value of refund is too high.....Plz plz can we expedite.,1
"I was all pro-Discovery Bank since August 2019 when I first saw the product being launched and I’ve had nothing but good experiences till now... to dispute a debit order, you need to fill out a plethora of paperwork, beg and plead, offer your first born child as sacrifice, yet these monkeys won’t reverse a debit order (where all other banks now allow you to do it yourself on their apps or internet banking) - why is it such a moerse issue for Discovery?

Secondly, I’ve recently lodged a case with your fraud department as R10,000 on the dot was transferred out of my account to an unknown beneficiary. Some rude a$$hole phoned me on the Monday morning and wAs exceptionally rude, constantly interrupting me and not listening to what I was saying. I say for instance “I did not make the transfer and only became aware of it now” then the friggin ***** would ask me “sorry, I don’t understand... who did you mean to send the money to?” - needless to say, after completely losing my temper at this half-loaf that couldn’t converse in English apparently, he told me I must send him an exact statement of what happened, because they don’t investigate the fraud behind transactions. F$&! Me!! What are you there for then. After about 30 minutes of this guy just getting more and more impatient and rude toward me, I told him I will send my affidavit and case number and then hung up the phone, because if I could and it was possible, I would’ve stabbed him in the face with a stapler over the phone. Absolutely waste of human flesh that one... the fraud department doesn’t investigate fraudulent transactions mos, they wait for the customer to tell them exactly what happened and who stole their money. ******* ID10T$!! If I knew what happened I wouldn’t be wasting my time with you lot then.

I haven’t responded to his email he apparently sent me and I’ve made peace that Discovery Bank is fast becoming like something from the 1970, and early 80’s... very advanced, I must say! God forbid you want to dispute anything on your account then you have to write a m****cript in response and there’s so much paperwork that I just want to point out that you guys SUCK as a digital bank when you insist on paperwork for everything from disputes that could last up to 30 days apparently, if you card is involved. Has anyone possibly informed you that Visa chargeback rules do NOT grant you 30 days to investigate! So best you get your **** together, because I see a lot of penalties in your not so distant future.

In any event, I want your legal reps details so I can serve the summons from the small claims court on Discovery Bank. Apparently it’s a massive inconvenience to check where the hell R10,000 somehow vanished! So my attorneys have advised that Discovery Bank has failed in their duties under several legislative acts of parliament and you can now be held liable for repayment of my stolen funds, within 14 days of the court summons reaching you. (I’ll have deliver it myself)

I’m so sick of this red tape Bu11**** when you have a pressing, urgent and serious matter at hand, that I want to throw up. The account thar money was transferred to should’ve been reported by you and frozen by the responsible bank immediately. 

The money is probably moved or spent by now because you guys take 3 days to respond to a fraud report / incident. I know Discovery is exceptionally incompetent in servicing of all their products that it was probably jus a matter of time before my perception of the bank would be shattered and casting it into the same ****ty basket as the rest of Discovery.

You are officially held responsible for the loss of R10,000 out of my transactional account and I intend on claiming this back from you, as its lost due to YOUR failure to act, putting ridiculously shallow and aggressive agents on my case and basically telling me to wave R10,000 goodbye.

The case is now being opened against Discovery Bank because I sure as **** don’t know who  took the money and give you exact chains of events that criminals follow to steal my money!!

I’m so over it... please just send me the details of your legal counsel so we may continue with the servicing of official notice to you; to be present in court when required. ",1

So far Discovery bank has been absolutely amazing. But recently I've reached a point where I'm struggling with something and not getting any help. I've called them twice now and keep going through the same thing and no one ever gets back to me.

Number one they block your account for alleged theft they ask you to give an affidavit too advise the account is not involved in any sort of scam etc you do as told by their fraud division and nothing.

From trying to register with uploading documents around 10 times, (purely for vitality reasons) it has been extremely painful and end up with a decline result when any other bank is happy to offer me a minimum of 300k card/loan/overdraft account. I applied for this purely for the benefit of getting an Apple Watch through the vitality program. I will rather pay the money cash and Discovery bank can carry on without my business.

One consultant managed to reverse the one months fees however all the other months I suffered a loss till they managed to close the account in November 2020.

They ensured me it is linked and I will get my rewards cashback with my PNP Online purchase. I never received the cashback for the online purchase. I have fwd the slip and made multiple calls and emails. The just reply with a escalation excuse. Initially they would have drawn the voice recording from the day. I am still awaiting this feedback.

1. Discovery Bank app indicates that I have no life insurance and medical aid, yet I do, with Discovery. 
2. Insure app never reflects daily driving behaviour points. The whole week is zero. 
3. Vitality, there's no way of checking reward statements, random allocations of discovery miles with no reference or way of knowing what it's for. Seems like a good way to rip clients off.

I've given up trying to get explanations for anything, hopefully the day comes when a better alternative becomes available. ",2

Thinking it was just a new card on the same account, I activated it on the Discovery app. After activating, the account balanced showed I owe R950 on the card for 6 months bank fees with interest but all the bank fee transactions are dated on the same day. The card was for a separate transaction account I never requested and never had for the past 6 months. I have been on the phone for 59 minutes and no one seems to know what to do, utter incompetence for a company that brands themselves as better than the rest. ",1
"Opened my account around end September 2020. uploaded relevant information for my vitality money status. noticed a debt management amount, upon enquiring with the relevant bank the account was proven to have been closed and has been updated on ITC immediately.all my credit reports since then don't reflect the amount as outstanding debt. have been calling discovery bank so many times and decided to just give up. are they actually worth keeping as a bank? that is what i ask myself now. no customer service, no directl lines, when you get transferred the call drops.

how are you to resolve anything like this? i have personally submitted all proof of account closure, i was advised discovery need to update based on credit score they pull. all good and well. its been 2 months and no update?

"Every single month I get charged interest on an account which is fully paid, and on time, by a debit order from Discovery Bank.  They admitted after it happened the first time that it was a glitch in the system and would fix it.  After a couple of months and lots of fighting, the charges were credited.  However, it still happens every month.  And every month I have to fight and complain to get it back.  Sometimes it works, but others it doesn't.  But every month the charges reappear.  Not just the current month, but several other entries going back months (obviously, as the system recalculates).  This means that I have to contact Discovery EVERY month after doing a recalculation.  The person I'm dealing with, Jaco Thompson at Discovery, is no help at all either.  In the beginning, he actually responded, but now there is just radio silence.  And I can't get to anyone more senior either, because you only speak to people in a call centre.

I reported them to the Ombudsman and after Discovery paid back the first three months, the Ombudsman closed the case, believing it was resolved.  But then the charges started again.",1
"Discovery Bank, please let me cancel my account. I have not used my account in about 2 years and am still being charged  fees even though I have twice asked for this account to be closed. This was first an FNB card and then moved over to Discovery Bank and i have now been charged annual fees or almost R900 for a service I have not even used.  I dont want to be called by an agent convincing me to stay. I want to close my account. Now i debited every month for an account that I do not even have a card for. This is twrrible service.",1
"I have written a review about Discovery bank before about fraud committed on my card and how I was initially promised they will sort it out within a couple of days. It is now a month ago and I am still waiting. 
Every time I phone the call centre they escalate the matter but I receive call back as they promise, just to have to call again and the same thing happens. After my initial review it took them a couple of days to reply privately on Hello Peter just to say that their records show that they have responded to me. What an absolute joke!
If your consultant answers the phone when I call you can't count that as responded to my query.
As the only thing the consultant can ever do is escalate the matter of which nothing ever comes.
My investigator (Abel) on the matter to whom I have spoken once before just doesn't return my call when it is escalated to him. 
The case took 2 weeks before the investigation started and once it was done he contacted me to confirm the refund will be in my account between 3-5 working days and of co**** I am still waiting 10 days later.
My queries are escalated to him as no one else can assist and he just doesn't return my calls.
This isn't a bank I ever want to deal with again in future. 
What if the money that was taken from my account was the last I had and I was unable to buy food because of these delays experienced with the bank. 
If I never have to deal with you again after this matter is hopefully resolved I won't.
You can take this as a customer you've lost for good and someone that will make sure lots of other people get to know about it as well. ",1
"Firstly, I want to start by thanking Daphney in the call centre at Discovery for her assistance with this query on Saturday. Truly it was incredible how she coordinated the entire query and I was really humbled. 

Secondly, I would like for Discovery to unlock my account, let me move my fund's out and they can then keep their account frozen. It is extremely pathetic that as a bank their bankers are not mandated to make inter account transfers for clients. Which bank doesn't do this? It is extremely pathetic that I have to beg discovery to move my own funds as I was stuck in a foreign province, fell sick and needed medical attention plus to attend to personal matters. It is an extreme invasion of privacy and contravention of the banking legislation that I have to explain my private business to junior staff of the fraud call centre and have them go head to head with me about my money. 

As a well rounded individual and very risk conscious human I made a decision to enter a casino to withdraw this large sum of money because the ATMs in that area were on the streets and I absolutely felt uncomfortable with making a withdrawal. The casino was the safest place. A few seconds later Discovery decides to lock my account. 

I was told this query is sitting with the Executives and I need these executives or whomever is their representative is to please release these funds and close this account. I am stuck in KZN and I need funds to travel back home today. 

Discovery bank already has a terrible reputation where their banking product is concerned and this experience which I will share with others has absolutely made matters worse. 

Can this be resolved urgently.",1
"A year ago i opened the account and it was worth it because i received nice benefits from it. Then couple of months later i ungraded the mobile app and see that thats not so anymore. I have sent numerious emails to my broker. Who cant assist. I have sent tweets, Facebook dms and made several phone calls but always directed to different department who says its Vitality problem and or redirect me to Bank. Its a month later and i have not receive any feedback from people who is in pocession of my money. This is scary and i want to worn everyone not to open an account with them. ",1
Clueless in understanding the refund process by Discovery Bank (Credit Card) and 0% accountability in updating the client when numerous emails are sent to product client support team just to understand how this refund process works when a merchant refunds the amount back into the Credit Card. Awaiting since 2 weeks :(. ,1
"For the past few months, I've been receiving messages that i owe your credit card money, i was issued the card by FNB on behalf of Discovery in 2014 or 2015,never used the card before, and why is Discovery now having an idea that I'll ever need or i should pay for something i am not using",1
"All I needed was a bank confirmation letter with a savings account balance on it. I did not want prior transactions showing on the document. This is not possible via the app and I called and them they could not simply provide me with a bank confirmation letter and savings account balance on one form. 

It’s a pity that discovery have got it so wrong. I have have tested multiple bank accounts in South Africa (ABSA, Nedbank, Standard Bank, FNB and Tyme) and Discovery are by “miles” the worst. What should be easy and simply is just impossible with them. 

I now have to open a bank account at another bank transfer all my money to that bank and get a statement within 48 hours for my visa application. 

I have discovery medical aid, vitality and a bank account and would advise anyone not to join discovery. I have the same problem with my vitality I have setup vitality rewards so many times and it re asks me to set it up. I have now gone over a year not getting discovery rewards because their apps don’t work. 

Their claim to fame is their digital bank however, what this really means is that instead of going into a branch you now have to sit on the phone with a consultant for anything you want to do that should be self service. ",1
"Migrating from FNB to Discovery Bank has been a nightmare for me. Imagine your credit card being areas because your repayments are bouncing back as a result of, and I have just found this one out, the ""blockages"" they put on my account. How absurd. ",1
"I've been trying for several months now to close my Discovery Bank credit card account, but it has proved to be a terribly frustrating experience. Firstly, Discovery Bank has a special help line for closures but, for some reason, is hardly ever answered. With the changeover to Discovery Bank, one gets a new account number. I had to try several times to find out how I could settle my account by EFT, before I got a positive answer. Just getting a settlement figure took several weeks. Eventually, I managed to settle my account but, despite several attempts, cannot get through to them on the relevant helpline to request a closure.  The bank's service leaves a lot to be desired.",1
I have reported my Credit Card for fraud on 25 October and card was cancelled. Since then I have received a new as replacement but it does not work after activation. I can do at most one transaction with the new card after which my transactions are declined. I have since received 2 new cards that are giving me the same problem and have spoken to Discovery Bank on a daily basis and on the 5 November they only realized that this is a general problem which other clients are also experiencing and will escalate the problem. Nothing has been done about this yet and in the meantime I have not had a working credit card for 2 weeks!!!,1
"I am a discovery client I have Pretty much all the products.

So for the past four months I have trying to move
Over to discovery bank to get access to my credit card. 

Not only has discovery bank utilized and linked my information to another person, concerning the POPI act. It took five escalations to get it sorted. 

I then ordered my card and got delivered  a card embossed with my husbands name in my card. I called this Saturday and escalated the matter reference number can be provided. Today is Thursday not one person has called me to sort out my issues.

"I belong to Discovery medical aid and Discovery Insure. Am trying to open a tax-free account with Discovery but am about to give up. I spent hours working on your website, got irritated by it, so asked for a consultant to contact me so I could SPEAK to them and get the info.  Being a senior citizen, my hours on this earth are  precious.  I have spent at least 4 or 5 of them trying to open an account with Discovery. Someone did phone me, very nice lady, and helped me to download your App and told me that everything would be fine on the App and I could research which bank account I want.  EXCEPT that when I sign on I am invited to open and 'savings account' and CANNOT get away from that screen to investigate other options.  I repeat.  My experience with your website, whether on my laptop or on the App. is appalling and I cannot waste any more time.  The latest trend of relying on stupid Apps to do business nowadays is extremely irritating and your shying away from speaking to a customer and opening up the account on the TELEPHONE is not acceptable to me.  Thank you. I will be going to African Bank to open my account.",1
"I have been receiving endless phone calls on an amount in ""arrears"" that I have paid for in July, which does reflect on my statement. I have explained myself to many agents and my issue is always escalated and never resolved. My account has now been handed over to a collections company, my account is not in good standing on the app, my card is blocked which I do not mind as I have received poor service from discovery but I really hope this doesn't impact negatively on my credit record as my account is on debit order and the amount was paid.

"Worse bank ever. Since they migrated my account from FNB to their own bank they have been useless. When you call them their phones don't work and constantly break up and you can't hear the person. I was never informed of the migration off the FNB system to their own bank and so had issues paying my account. I now paid double what I should of paid yet I'm told my account is been placed in restriction. Tried calling and what do you know can't hear the call center guy. 

Worst bank EVER",1
This is probably the worst business i have ever dealt with. Firstly they've been charging me for a card that i cancelled last year. Secondly i've called their call center over 10 times to log a complaint and get the matter resolved but to no avail. The promise is the same..'Ï will escalate it to our supervisor and they will get back to you''. Guess what they never do! I sent messages on their platform for them to call me back and have received ZERO response. I tried cancelling the card through the discovery app. ZERO Feedback. I called their call center and was on hold for over half an hour before i hung up! ZERO response again. This bank is beyond useless! This bank is like a really bad SCAM that takes your money! ,1
"I migrated from RMB to Discovery. I suddenly know sit with a negative amount in my credit card of tens of thousands of rands. Nobody seems trained to assist me.
I need to speak to a real person one to one who can assist. With Covid 19 I have also requested and completed reductions in policies I own. Arranged to reduce payments on debit orders. This indeed happened in October but now has reverted back to previous DO amount. very annoying, ",1
"Since my credit card was forcibly migrated from Discovery to Discovery Bank, I have been charged interest despite the 55 day free interest I used to get.

I believe their fine print is deliberately omitted and no email address provided to clarify the conditions just to charge one with Interest. 

So for whatever obtuse reason it seems impossible for me to get the 55 free interest.

If I were not forced by vitality to have a credit card with them I would have cancelled it immediately

Wish I knew before I got hooked into this

"I have been trying to close my discovery credit card account since the 20th of July, i have called in 4 times now around this. I even received an apology mail from their group chief executive on the 4th of September around their unacceptable service (no doubt a system generated mail, as i have responded twice with no response). Discovery have told me that they had a technical error which occurred on the 11th of September which prevented the payment, this technical error has almost lasted 2 months, so I'm calling BS and delay tactics. I was told on my last call to discovery that their account closure SLA is 30 days, how is this enforced as I am currently on day 107. Be very careful with this lot, I would recommend using VBS over discovery right now. Terrible service, steer clear of this bank. They are quick to sign you up and promise the world but you can never leave. ",1

The number does not work. I then called and spoke to a lady by the name of Innocentia Maleye who confirmed that she is not allowed to give me (the client) Nabantu's email address as they communicate on skype and she will not be able to. I advised her that most companies use Outlook and told her how to search for an employee which she responded that she not allowed to provide the email address to me. I am absolutely appalled by the level of service and how I am being treated. In line with TCF I was not requested any information and then be told that I did not provide feedback. Innocentia Maleye requested the relevant department to furnish me with the proof where correspondence was sent to me requesting bank details etc. She confirmed that the system notes stated that I did not respond. Is this a tactical way for Discovery to charge me bank charges for a new month. It surely can not take 11 working days for someone to attend to a cancellation. What I would like to know, if I was a new customer applying for a credit card , I am sure it would have been made available immediately for me to use Discovery's funds and pay an interest. For me to get my money back and cancel my credit card is an issue. It really feels like discovery is going out of their way to make this process difficult. Ironically someone from your sales department called me yesterday to sell something to me but no one called to assist me with my cancellation. 
Is discovery living up to the brilliant standards that they make people believe? Definitely not, I have never heard of a company say they have work emails that the client's cannot have access to. Please do yourself a favor and listen to your call recordings when furnishing feedback. 

I need this to be sorted out this week. I will not be charged anything pertaining to fees from the 20th October 2020. I want written proof that Discovery attempted to or contacted me regarding this.

THEY HAVE TAKEN MONEY FROM MY ACCOUNT.  I HAD A CREDIT BALANCE ON THE OLD DISCOVERY CREDIT CARD - WHEN THE DISCOVERY BANK OPENED MY BALANCE WAS BROUGHT FORWARD AS NIL. HAVE EMAILED AND CALLED ON NUMEROUS (11 OCCASIONS) BUT STILL NO RESPONSE OR SOLUTION.  THEY KEEP TAKING MONEY OFF OUR ACCOUNT - WITHOUT SIGNED CONSENT (OR ANY CONSENT FOR THAT MATTER). I HAVE A CASE NO BUT THAT STILL DOESNT SEEM TO HELP. THIS HAS BEEN GOING ON SINCE - JULY 2020. JUST CANNOT GET ANY HELP.  NEXT STEP IS OMBUDSMAN AND LAWYERS,1
After many mails and reviews in Hello Peter I am still left in the dark re the money which was withdrawn from my card after it was stolen and cloned. FNB says it is Discovery's problem and Discovery Bank says it is FNB's problem. In the mean time I am the one who lost the money.,2

DISCOVERY BANK IS REFUSING TO ASSIST WITH QUERY - ITS BEEN OVER TWO MONTHS.  THEIR COMPLAINTS DEPARTMENT IS ALSO NOT BOTHERED TO ASSIST,1
"Discovery's communications needs some serious improvement...

Asking questions before signing up took a monumental effort and great deal of airtime on my part. Additionally, I made the effort to find out all the information I could but, upon receiving my account, I suddenly had a transactional and savings account. I was not made aware of that structure when I called. So I followed up with several more calls and an email for 4 communications in total. 2 consultants told me that the savings account was an additional R15 per month but another 2 consultants told me it was free and included in my plan. I don't like receiving these kinds of mixed messages and being left in the dark about my monthly fees. Hashtag not impressed...

I've been trying to get an FA to call me back concerning other financial products for more than 2 months. Unlike other insurance companies who won't leave me alone, discovery doesn't seem interested to make the effort to call me back and actually tell me about their products. Hashtag very disappointed.

Then, they allegedly dropped R30k in my account by mistake. How does that even happen? What sort of system are they running where this kind of mistake is possible??? A consultant called me to make me aware of this however, I was on holidays and the time was inconvenient. We scheduled a time for a call back later that same day. They didn't. They never even tried agaon

If this transaction was indeed an error, I would be willing to return those funds (at absolutely no cost to myself) however, due to this and the other aforementioned inconveniences and incompetencies, I do believe that I should be compensated in some way. I have dropped a large sum of my own personal savings into discovery fixed deposit accounts and this is the thanks I receive as a new client??? Are they crazy or just poorly organised? 

I suggest and request that they actually make the effort to contact me, with a sincere apology, and provide me with some free vitality banking points for all the inconveniences I've suffered. This might just motivate me to stay with discovery and deposit more money in the future. I also believe that I should be compensated for all this inconvenience with some discovery points.

In summary, while discovery bank's products and discounts look fantastic on paper, I regret signing up with them. They have offered nothing but inconveniences, poorly organised services, and a complete lack of communication.",1

I cannot recommend this bank enough. I was looking for a bank that had affordable fees so that I could open an account for savings and side hustles. At R10 per month the discovery gold transaction account was perfect. I sent in an inquiry on the website and within 2 minutes I received a call and in a total of 10 minutes my account was open. I am still baffled at how fast the process was and I DID NOT HAVE TO GO INTO A BRANCH which was my biggest issue with other banks. Fabulous service and friendly staff! I feel secure and I feel that my money is safe. The card is super pretty too;) I can't wait to start my saving journey with SA's first behavioral bank! Thank you Discovery Bank!,5
This is the first time in a year since I've opened my current account and 32 Notice Savings account that I've had a problem and did tell a lot of people they should open an account with you as it is so easy. So it is a bit dissapointing now. My notice I gave that should have been paid out 26 Oct is still not paid. I logged a complaint telephonically on 28 Oct and they said to resolve it.

2) Received an email offering an account ""colour change"", tried to accept, failed, phoned in, was told to update my app, updated app, problem persists.
Last week I called in, was told the reason was that I have a bad credit record - I ABSOLUTELY DO NOT have a bad credit record, was transferred to credit department to be told I was in the wrong department, held on for feedback, got cut off.
The only reason I may be defined as a bad customer is due to the fact that you levied 3 amounts of interest on my credit card account in March and April due to your own mess up that required 3 calls to get resolved.
Somebody called back promising feedback shortly.

This amount is not a lot but my question that I asked the agent was how many other people is this happening to. The agent told me he will call up his manager and ask him to assist, the agent put me on hold for quite sometime he then came back and he told me his manager will call me back I asked him to transfer me to his manager and his response was I spoke to him on Whatsapp, How unprofessional is that? When I first joined discovery I was so happy and recommended so many people to Discovery bank as I felt that the service was second to none but number 1. But now I wouldn't recommend discovery bank to any1",1
"Discovery bank is incompetent, should have not left FNB when can’t even replace a credit card. I have been calling them logging queries since July but up until today no one is able to issue me a card. In their app it shows that I have an active card. ",1
"It all started with Discovery card a year ago first managed by fnb and now discovery bank. Fraudulent transactions ignored and even after I went to the ombudsman and they opened the case and a commitment from Discovery to refund us - in July 2020, I still haven't been refunded, I'm still be charged interest and I am still bot getting a response from Discoveru bank. Last week i even spoke to a manager to get it resolved and heard nothing since except getting a call from their collection  department asking for money they say we owe them. 
They are a disgrace to the service of banking. Fnb Tells us to contact discovery bank, discovery bank tells us to contact fnb. Weve got proof from fnb that discovery bank was paid the money to refund us, yet weve not been paid. So far they have no intention of paying us all the interest weve been charged and paid to them since Sept 2019. 
Shocking.",1
"I was not using my Discovery Blue card, and was paying a monthly account fee of R90 for it, so I phoned FNB to close it. They referred me to Discovery Bank to close it. I paid all outstanding amounts and requested to close the account in March 2020. I got a call a few days later from Discovery Bank, promising me the moon and stars and all kinds of wonderful multi-coloured banking unicorns, and was told I would not be charged while I made up my mind, and that I could select from the options on the app or website. For a few weeks after that, I regulraly checked the app and website, and could see no options whatsoever. For a while, my profile disappeared completely. I tried calling numerous times, but an answering service told me to use the app or the website. I discovered some time thereafter that I was indeed still being charged R90 a month - and the bill was now R90 x 4. I paid it up at the beginning of August and insisted the account be closed. I was promised it would be closed. I refused to listen to any more stories about multi-coloured banking unicorns. It took numerous calls and three more weeks before my account was actually closed at the end of August. I check my credit report every month, and it has still not been updated - Discovery has been dragging my credit score down with ""arrears"" that don't exist on an account that has been closed. I called today to ask them to please update my payment history with the credit bureau. After 20 minutes and being passed to three different people, nd landing up again with the first person, I was given an email address *********** to send the paid-up account closure letter to, and was told that they would update my details with the credit bureau. When the account closure letter eventually came through, I duly emailed it to the email address I was given. I received the following automated response:
""Hello
Thanks for getting in touch with us.
This is an automated response. Please note that this mailbox deals with credit applications. We will not respond to other queries here.
If you have any other queries, please call **********.

The Discovery Bank team""

How will I get Discovery Bank to update my details with the credit bureau? For behavioural bank, they're behaving pretty badly. 

I'm going out of my mind. This is the worst bank I have ever had the misfortune of dealing with. Don't fall for them. They're completely infuriating. ",1
"They were amazing and prompt in dealing with my problem with illegal payments been taken off my card. My problem was resolved immediately and within a week I was refunded the illegal payments taken off my card.

Wow discovery i have called you just after 8am on the 19th October for an early withdrawal out of my 32 day account. It was supposed to have reflected by the end of that day or latest yesterday on the 20th. I told you its an emergency and you have left me in the dark after countless of calls. Please release my R3000 that i requested into my transactional account. I also stated not to contact me about a penalty fee as i don't mind it and just to process the request. I now have a declined transaction and this is so embarrassing. ,1
"Worst ever, closed down my FNB account to move to Discovery bank I was promised the moon and the starts, all that I got was **** trying to sort out.
My cards keep on going thru and reversing the transactions this has been going on more than a month to sort out !!!!! I spoke to numerous consultants and team leaders at Discovery Bank the strange thing is I need to phone the whole time to follow up, NO ONE is getting back to me. The service is shocking and disgusting!! At the end of the day I look like a fool in front of my clients with my cards not going thru, also to add I need to transfer funds from my bank account to another bank account as immediate payment so I can access funds, this COST'S money for these types of transfers. I need this resolved ASAP or I will just close down my accounts and move back to FNB. 
I AM FED UP !!!!",1
"Poorly trained staff, giving incorrect advice when asked basic questions and then failure to follow up. I never received documents they promised to send, nor do they call back (ever - not even late!). Their bad advice had given me a false sense of security, only to end up loosing thousands of rands. Managers never call back when you ask to escalate matters. ",1
Yes my account was closed early in September but I still have not been refunded the positive balance available at time of closure. I have supplied my banking details a few times already!,1
"I am really disappointed in my latest interactions with Discovery Bank. There was fraud on my credit card which they were very quick to pick up after the third transaction in 3 minutes however the service after have left a lot to be desired. The fraud took place on Friday after which I was asked to complete their dispute form. The consultant confirmed it to be a very straight forward process and a 24 hours turnaround time for the process to be completed.
This was quite the opposite I have experienced to date.
I then struggled to send the completed form as I received bounced emails of the mailbox being full. 

On Monday I eventually contacted the bank and the consultant confirmed that the mailbox was full. She requested that I send her the form directly which will be sent to the investigators. 
I phoned on Wednesday with another consultant promising the investigator to contact me. With no call I again phoned on Friday. The consultant requested I go to the police station to the report the crime and that turnaround is actually 72 hours (this was already passed 72 hours).
This just became ridiculous as I was never asked this before.
I phoned on Monday at 16;08 and was advised that I should call back as the department had already left.
Today Tuesday I phone and another consultant advises that he will escalate the matter to the investigator. He was unable to confirm that on the system there was an escalation before. Non the less I am still waiting and it is again after hours so no call today.

I have no idea what is going on. There has been no communication from Discovery bank. If I don't contact them I don't hear anything.

I am happy to say that I am glad I have not moved all of my accounts to Discovery bank and that after this experience I will not do business with them again.
It's a pity because I think they have a good thing going with Vitality Money but rewards is not all that is required of a bank. Service is key!

Poor service from the account closure department. You’ll wait for months to have your account closed.,1
"For a few months I have been trying to cancel my account because of Discovery Bank's ridiculously high bank costs, but every time they insist that someone will give me a call back to cancel the account. Every call I get is to move my account or to upgrade my account. When I call Discovery and eventually speak to an agent this person also whats me to wait for someone to call me back. When I insist on closing my account immediately, they transfer me to another agent that never picks up the call. Even after their little song stops for five minutes no one picks up the phone. I am very sorry that I ever supported this useless and expensive Discovery Bank. Luckily I already closed all my other Discovery products a while ago. All of Discovery's products are expensive and the service has never been satisfactory. I am very disappointed in their Discovery Bank, even after I asked them to make sure the next agent picks up the phone I waited for nothing. They are simply time wasters. I urge others not to fall into this never ending trap.",1
Discovery Miles are super useful goes the advertising.... So I tried to use my hard earned Discovery Miles to by off Takelot..... One of their naned partners.

"I have ben following up on my enquiry for well over a week now and I still haven't received a response from Discovery Bank's complaints department.

"i have a discovery credit card that i maxed out a few years ago, there was then an arrangement maid to pay a certain amount which i stuck by in paying every month. i was then retrenched because of COVID end of July 2020 so i was looking for a grace period so that i can just find another job. I started by phoning the number on my statement **********, they couldn't assist me in any way.

I then told her that i am unemployed and will try to make payments BUT surely there should be a insurance that can pay out when something like this happens. She then said that she will not be able to assist and that i need to contact the bank WHICH I DID NUMERIOUS TIMES WITH NO SUCCSESS. Now, nobody even phoned or notified me that they are handing over my account and if there is anything that i can do.
Now what can i do now?",1

Their Call center or Customer services is hopeless, they've been sending me from pillar to post, I just want to pay that R1350 i owe on your Credit card and close the account, i see no future in this bank. 6 months they can't solve a simple admin thing, how about a transactional matter.

"I have used my Discovery Healthy Gear benefit many times over the past few years and was very pleased when I was able to increase my percentage benefit even more with Discovery bank.
I was extremely annoyed when the timing of the monthly spend was changed without any specific clear communication.  Ie, it used to be based on your calendar month spend.  (1st to 31st) I was caught out in January 2020 when I had already maxed my R2,000 healthy gear spend on 21 December 2019 and I bought again on Saturday 4 January 2020 thinking it would fall into a new month and I would have access to a new R2,000 spend limit.  
But no, these 2 purchases were lumped together as I was informed that my cut off was now “about the 10th” of the month.  And I effectively got no cashback for the purchase made in January.
Fast forward to Saturday 3 October 2020 and I went to Sportsman’s Warehouse to use my 11 Sep – 10 Oct month’s R2,000 Healthy gear purchasing allowance.
I note now that Discovery have been super-efficient this month and decided to cut off early as I received my Healthy care and healthy food Discovery miles on the 6th of October but no, payment for healthy gear!  I assume this is because I have had my purchase on the 3rd rolled into the next month.  Yet you *****ed me over by including the previous purchase on the 4th of the month into the previous month!
Please can you allocate this to September, recalculate this and pay me my healthy gear.
And could you please advise exactly what date my Healthy-care “month” starts and ends as this guesswork and randomness is infuriating!  It cannot be whenever you get to it sometime within the first 10 days of the month!

"As a Discovery card client for 20 years I have tried on numerous occasions to upgrade/join Discovery Bank. 

My conclusion/experience after spending a huge amount of time with consultants on the phone is as follows: 

Discovery bank managent have no interest whatsoever in serving their customers but rather expect customers to do their work for them. The Discovery bank IT department apparently are useless amateurs who dont umderetand their own systems because they insist that Discovery card clients needing to join the bank do their work for them. 

Discovery bank management refuse to call back any client with a legitimate problem under any circumstances. 

Discovery bank is interested only in communicating with the masses and their systems are designed only for call ins to call centers and no customer complaint will be followed up under any circumstances.

Discovery bank will threaten legal action as soon as a Discovery card account is in arrears by 2 or three days even when the client has not been sent a statement referring the amount owing and even when the client is unable to use his expired card.

This stopped from July and we have been emailing Vitality and Discovery Bank every 2 days to try and get an explanation to no avail.  Today I discovered that the cash back has been changed to a Discovery Miles reward, so we get miles instead of money.  Why was this change not communicated to us and why did it change at all?  In addition, why could not one single consultant explain this to us in the 3 months that we have been querying this?  ",1
"I have for almost a year trying to close this account down. next month will be 12 months going. After numerous emails and calls this matter is still not yet resolved. They refunded the balance that i had and started deducting from me again.Now im in arrears for R99. All the funds that i had in the account has been eroded due to monthly charges for the past 12 months. Shocking and appalling service even after i have sent emails , Twitter and calls .",1
Since my Discovery Card moved to Discovery Bank it has been impossible to use the card or even now to pay. Cannot add their Bank Details to my personal FNB bank account. They do not even have my correct details on record. When you try and phone (tried 4 times) you go through their system type your ID etc. only to be cut off when trying to speak to a banker? How do you deal with a bank that you cannot phone or e-mail. This is pathetic service to say the least.,1
I opened a 12 month investment account and when I didnt see interest accumulated after the 1'st month I called to find out why and if I can get a statement.  Apparently - they cannot show the interest because I said I want the interest paid out at the end of the 12 month period.  That is insane.  Surely i should be able to see if.  It seems like they are hiding something.  Every other bank shows the interest received per month.  I worry that if i wait for the end of the year they are only going to pay out the interest off my initial payment and not my accumulated monthly interest.  Every time I call the call centre they tell me there is no manager available - that also cannot be the case.  It seems very dodgy to me. ,1
"They advertise that you get vitality and receive discounts on flights and Virgin active, Every time i call the call center no one can give me my vitality number to access these discounts and basically everyone is clueless. Mathapelo couldn't do a manual verification she put me through to someone else that cant and i ended up on holding on the line. He wants to transfer me to Vitality that cant help me as well. Great app but the Call Center staff needs training. ",1
"For months we have been trying to close the account.  First the computer didn't like the sound in the background (said there was too much - whose working there the computer or the people!)  Then numerous emails with no reply.  Phone calls that just didn't get answered - we are retired and need our airtime for other things.  Eventually yesterday got through was given a Case No. to cancel, BUT HEY WAIT FOR IT, it will take 2 months ????  I Think they need to contact Virgin Money - it took 2 emails one requesting closure and then one giving the information they required.  The credit card account charges fees each month and they are taking the fees each month - nothing is being spent on the cards - why the procrastination?  So now it is a waiting game.....",1
"SO MUCH FOR BETTER BANKING! I WAS FORCED, NOT GIVEN AN OPTION, FORCED OVER TO DISCOVERY BANK AUTOMATICALLY. THEIR SERVICE IS NON-EXISTENT! CONTACT CENTER IMPOSSIBLE TO GET HOLD OF.

"My bank account was debited, for R500 .  I have been calling discovery since april 20 
to get my refund, Spoke to many people , kensani,Kanyisele,Kensani,Tshepiso, Nonku.
Left a message on the 6 August 20 for the manager to assist, Louren Smith. She has not returned my call. Spoke to a floor manager, Linda on the 6 August 20 , said she will look into it , have not heard from her. Public beware of such debits on your bank account.",1
"I would like to close my Discovery Bank account, but the only way to do so is by phoning a call centre. They have stopped accepting emails and have no online way to do so (of course you can open an account online). How is someone who is overseas supposed to interact with you?",1
I logged a dispute on the 8th of September case number ********** and received and email that a discovery banker would call me but as is TYPICAL of discovery bank NO ONE CALLED. I called in on the 18th and spoke to Kagiso who PROMISED TO CALL ME BACK on the 21st - NO CALL RECEIVED. I had to CALL IN AGAIN today as THREE WEEKS LATEER there is no response from discovery and they are STILL unable to give me feedback???,1
"I have been trying to set up a secondary Discovery Bank credit card account for the last 3 weeks.  I was 'invited' (their term) by my husband to join the bank as a secondary account holder and followed the instructions per the app precisely.  Since then its been a nightmare!!! After emails, phone calls, kept on hold, departments not answering their phones, I can honestly say this has been the most frustrating thing I've every tried to do!  And I am still getting nowhere! One would swear I'm trying to get on a flight to Mars!",1
"For every purchase paid with my credit cards, I get 2-3 emails and 1-2 SMS notifications.
Twice I called the call centre to ask for only ONE SMS notification to my cellphone for every activity, on any of the Four cards in my account. 
ONE and ONLY ONE NOTIFICATION is required!!!!!
No emails and no notifications to any of the secondary card holders either.
Calls to the call centre are being ignored, after making you wait on the line for 10-15 minutes before an answer. Another forced waste of the customer;s time. 
Discovery Bank is wasting my time by having to read multiple notifications.
Before the credit cards were transferred from FNB management to Discovery Bank, I used to just get one SMS. Why did the change to Discovery Bank make the system less efficient? 
Fix your system, we pay enough in fees to deserve a better service!!",1
"Not sure if it's worth writing this as Discovery Bank doesnt respond on this site.
I'm so tired of spending money on calling Discovery bank consultants for queries that never get resolved. Discovery Bank does not have an email address",1
"Wish I could give this ""bank"" a negative rating. I have been trying to close my credit card account for months now!  On the 15th of July 2020, I notified Discovery Card division that my credit card had been settled in full and requested that the account be closed. I included all my contact details and a certified copy of my ID with the request. No response. On the 24th of July 2020, I requested an update on the closure of the account as it still hadn't been done. No acknowledgment was received whatsoever. However, the account was removed from my FNB profile, so I assumed that it had been finalized and closed. (This is how I always accessed the account) However, on the 9th of September 2020, I received a Discovery bank statement for the first time in my life! The statement was for some unrecognized account. Apparently, R39.06 in interest was charged to the credit card account after I had settled it and after it had been removed from my FNB profile. This was then transferred to a new Migration account but was then reversed on the same day??? Since then fees and charges have been raised on this new migration account. A debit order was initiated against my FNB account without my consent for payment of this new migration account. FNB claims there's nothing that they can do and I have been unable to get any response from Discovery Bank.

I have no use for or access to a Discovery Bank account as I am living overseas and have no active Discovery Bank cards in my possession. The account was settled in full and closure was instructed numerous times. However, charges are being raised instead. This action by Discovery Bank is not acceptable and smacks of fraud. All the fees and charges are to be reversed immediately as I requested that the account be closed on the 15th of July 2020 almost 2 and a half months ago, and I never consented to a new account! I am not going to keep paying for Discovery Bank's utter incompetence. REFUND THE DEBITS RAISED, REVERSE THE CHARGES AND CLOSE THE ACCOUNT!!!! ",1
"Three emails have been forwarded to Discovery Bank requesting the issue of the New Platinum Discovery Bank Credit Card.
This transfer was initiated by Discovery Bank upon the transfer of the credit cards from previously known Discovery Credit Card to the New Discovery Platinum Credit Card.
Fantastic service from a ""new"" Bank !!!!!!!!

"I have been struggling to cancel my Discovery Credit Card for a couple of months now and being charged the monthly fee every month. I finally managed to cancel my card myself via the online platform after back and forth email correspondence did not do the trick and now I am still charged the monthly fee after I canceled the card.

Could someone from Discovery Bank urgently contact me via email as I am abroad and not happy that I must pay for a service that I am not using. I shouldn't be paying! ",1
"I reported numerous fraudulent transactions on my Credit-card on 14 August 2020.  My Credit-card was cancelled and on 17 August informed that a new card is being prepared.  On 24 August a fraud case (ref no **********) was logged. I received a Dispute Form to complete on 27 August (Case no **********) and completed it the same day and sent it back.  Of note is that transactions keep on being processed and declined on the canceled Credit-card.  By 22 September, I now have sent three emails enquiring about the outcome of my query.",1
I have been trying to close my Discovery credit since the beginning of the year.  I have been calling their complaints department - no-one picks up.  My e-mails are also ignored. I received a call to finalize closing balance about a month ago with a promise to send a mail with steps to close off the card - still waiting.  Please can you help me to close this card - it is hugely expensive,1
"What a bad idea to try the new state of the art bank Some issues I had first a stupid thing like having a debit order reversed... 15days no luck, we will escilate and get back to you...no one gets back to you.  No managers or supervisors to talk to.  Today I needed stamped statements for spesific dates also WE CANNOT DO THAT wait for the next month.  This is simple stuff I could do on my own at my previous bank now not even a banker banker can do this for you...",1
"Absolutely shocking service. None of the CS agents know what's happening with the miles and whenever they transfer me to the rewards department, there is no answer. awesome concept, shockingly executed!!",1
"I started banking with discovery a few months ago, I heard it’s the best with rewards. I’ve been saving for the past 6 months so now I wanted to get access to my money and I can’t. I’ve been sending emails and getting no response. I’m devastated as this money is supposed to go good cause.",1
"My involvement with the Discovery brand spans many years wrt Discovery Health, Discovery Insurance and Discovery Bank (when underwritten by FNB). Sadly, when Discovery Bank became independent, the wheels fell off completely! SOMEHOW the email address I used for all 3 Discovery entities was replaced by an email address I did not register for banking and subsequently, became an email address of a company I no longer work with. The issue, is that after EVERY transaction, a notification email (which I did not sign up for) was sent to this latter address, giving access to ALL my banking information and available credit to whoever is now managing this address! After 1 attempt via the Discovery Banking App, and 3 telephonic attempts to correct this major issue (a HUGE mystery to me is how the independent Discovery Bank gained access to this email address in the first place - I understand blockchain but YIKES, is this not invasion of the Access to Personal Information Act?) I gave up. The tipping point, was that I received a new Discovery Credit card delivered to my home in July 2020 to replace my card which is to expire in October 2020. In September, I got a call from Discovery Bank to say that I would be getting a new credit card. I tried to explain to the lady that they had already delivered my replacement card. She kept cutting me off to explain all the new features of the card. Eventually, after she started to talk to me like a kid and I kept trying to tell her that I didn’t want them to send me another card as there must be some mistake, SHE threw the phone down! I immediately closed my account. Discovery - stay in your lane and stick to Healthcare! Banking should be left to the Big Girls and Boys. ",1
Immediate payment is not real-time payment at Discovery Bank.  It takes 24 to 48 hours. I am very disheartened. ,1
"Discovery Bank is possibly the worst banking institution I have ever dealt with. When FNB administered the credit card I sometimes had issues but they were always resolved without too much effort. Since Discovery Bank took over I have had endless problems. My Discovery Miles were cancelled because I hadn't paid my subscription according to Discovery Bank. That is strange because the payment always gets added to my statement which I pay in full every month. I have contacted Discovery Bank 4 times over the last month and each time I get a different answer with respect to my Discovery miles. It seems none of the call centre staff really know what is going on. The first person I spoke with has not got back to me as promised in over a month. Furthermore, I entered my new card details with Netflix. It was tested by their system. An amount of R1 was charged and then refunded. Yet two days later the monthly payment was rejected by Discovery Bank. I don't know why and neither did the call centre assistant. There are always promises to assist with a problem but no one ever does. They always ask for a rating of their service despite the fact that there is never any service. They are positively the worst banking institution I have ever come across. I am seriously considering cancelling my credit card. Anyone thinking of joining their bank should think twice and then again before joining such a totally incompetent organisation.",1
"I continually get a */*=-/ promotion advert to join this */-/** Bank!!

There is no option to Unsubscribe.

"I unfortunately lost my wallet and needed to order a replacement credit card.  This request was done almost 2 weeks ago through the 24 hour fraud line because the APP and the telephonic options available to replace cards didn't work.  The replacement request was done outside of normal business hours but was 100% as a result of the App not working or the customer care line having an option for lost/stolen cards that worked beyond trading hours.  After waiting a week I called for an update only to find out that the card was still active and not cancelled as requested and that no new card was ordered.  So I repeated the whole process and still nothing has transpired, on top of this now, I have called 3 more times now to speak to a banker to sort this out, sent screengrabs of the error from the app as well as sent multiple follow-up mails finding out where my card is or when the ""banker"" will be contacting me as the automated ""no-reply"" mails from Ayanda and the Clients Documents auto reply states....both void of a reference number let alone feedback....seriously what's going on....I get you are all working remotely, does this mean that you can't do your jobs, make outbound calls or issue reference numbers?  

To top things off, one has to commend the arrogance of this bank when they inform customers we do not respond to e-mails, it's not like they respond to phone calls either, lets see how they respond to complaints and disgust over poor service delivery now....one would think they pay you to be a member with this type of exclusive mindset and disdain for customers.

One thing I am certain of, DISCOVERY BANK will not be late or delayed in issuing their statements, charging customers bank fees or charging me for a replacement card that I'm still waiting for almost 2 weeks now and followed up on countless times and had no joy yet!",1
"After investing R 10,000,000.00 with Discovery Bank and trying to ask some questions no one bothers to call back.
I have had contact with 3 people from Discovery Bank and have had three promises that someone would call me back, none has bothered…
I feel sorry for the sucker who only invests R1000.00

"I have been a Vitality member for probably 20 years, and when they ran their credit cards through FNB is was a pleasant experience, until Discovery decided to try their hand at banking, and took everything in-house. My card expired in March, now in order for you to get a new one, you have to join Discovery banking, but it is almost impossible as I have been battling for almost a month now to get this right. Firstly the App that you have to download does not work. Then the agent, who I spent 43min on the phone trying to get this done, tells you send document to an email, which you never get a response form, then when you, the customer call them to find out what is happening, they give you a different email to send documents to and tell you that everything will be resolved in 24 hours. But, yes, I am still waiting for my call back. The kicker is that even if you are up to date with payments, they bombard you with message to pay your account. Perhaps you should consider leaving banking to actual banks ",1
"I’m so over trying to get a new card issued - the new Discovery bank app has been giving me an error for a month +. I’ve spent time on the phone with consultants, who keep telling me to try again later & when o asked how else to order a new card I was told to try from the website, with no luck. I’m tired of calling & ive sent countless emails - and yet...still no luck! ",1
"Judging by the other reviews I am not alone. They claim to be the new age agile digital behavioural bank? Non of that. They cannot find my profile for 4 weeks, I cannot cancel my credit card.  which was merged from the old Discovery Card service managed by FNB. Nothing. They are absolutely useless. ",1
"I ordered a new credit card at the end of August 2020 and before the new card could be delivered, I called customer services and advised them that the banking app shows the incorrect details will be embossed on the card and my details needs to be changed before delivery. My call was disregarded and on 3rd September the card was delivered with incorrect details after me notifying them that the system had the wrong details. I have been calling customer services from the date of delivery to present to get the correct details embossed on the card. After several calls I was told on Monday, 15th September that my details are now correct and I must choose a replacement card on the app. I have tried to do so but it keeps giving me an error. I called customer services and the agent was of no use which I requested Pamela who was assisting with the correct embossed details to call me back to assist with the ordering of a replacement card. I have not received any call back or assistance in terms of ordering a replacement card. I always brag about Discovery’s services but something as simple as embossing the correct details could not be done and I am still waiting for assistance. ",1
"Since the introduction of this bank and the app my life has become hell. I cancelled a card for my son, because we did not follow the ""correct"" procedure in registering etc etc. To fix this is apparently impossible, even though we stared the whole process from scratch this wonderful app still has my son's ID somewhere in the MATRIX, so he cannot log into the app to register his ""NEW"" card.

"I'm trying to close my account with Discovery Bank after having my Discovery Card automatically transferred to the above mentioned Bank. 
I started on 2/7/2020 spoke to KEA ref ********** with the request (Nay instruction to close this account as I neither requested it nor want it)

So on 16/7/2020 I called again only to be given the run around by Discovery Bank Client services ,this time told I was required to pay an amount to get the account to a zero balance before the account can be closed. - deposited the amount the following day
Phoned again 21/7/2020  spoke to Thuli Qiniso who assured me the account was closed.
On 17/8/2020 received a statement from Discovery Bank for a account that was supposedly closed.  She also said that the account was closed but had "" Somehow been reactivated""
On 16/9/2020 I again received a statement with R37.50 debit reflecting for ""Service Fees""
Phoned discovery Bank and spoke to Aobeakw -ref ********** and requested to speak to a senior person as I was not getting results from the call center.
I was told that this was not possible due to Covid -19 restrictions but that she would escelate to a manager to call me. (Hah Hah)

Now, the email stated that on their records they have my external bank account number and if I want to change it I should respond. So, because the account number is correct as per their records, I didn't respond. Cause, I don't want to nominate a different external bank account.

I consequently received an email 5 days later to tell me because I haven't responded they have closed the case but my Discovery Bank Credit Card is still active. 

CLOSE MY ACCOUNT!!!!

"My review is not on the bank as such, but more around the additional ""perks"" they provide. 

We bought our tickets using our discovery bank credit card, and qualified for the ""free"" travel insurance. Due to CODID-19, we had to cancel. We managed to get most of our money back from the agents, but there were some fees which we could not.  While the policy wording states that this is not covered, it is disheartening to note that the insurance policy which is supposed to assist us in a loss, does not. After carefully reading the exclusions and convoluted wording, i am convinced that there are very few situations whereby they would actually be required to pay out. Even all the discounts they claim on their products are dubious with finely worded exclusions. Another issue I had with this transaction is that Discovery refuses to refund my flights in full even though we were in lockdown. The claim they provided was airline taxes are non-refundable, even though Emirates states on their website that they are refunding all tickets in full, which included the flights that we purchased. I wish I could give them a lower rating. I will be slowly migrating all the products I purchased from Discovery to somewhere else. ",1
My discovery credit card have been migrated from fnb to discovery bank without me giving authorization. My account should be paid off and closed by now but all of a sudden I owe R26000. This keeps staying unresolved no matter how many times I phone. I keep getting emails saying that I need to py R26000 if I want to clos emy account. My statement changed draatically from one month to the other. Everytime I phone I have to expalin everything from the top again. getting nowhere. Getting statements and paying interest on an amount that I do not rightfully owe. Discovery by now owes me money. Nothing is being done about this. I cannot just close account by settling an amount that I do not owe. Hoe long will this be going on???? ,1
"I had a refund issued to my account on 10th of July 2020. It is now 16 September and Discovery still can't ""locate the payment"" despite me sending them references and even tracing numbers.

"Discovery Bank / World First Behavioural Bank. The name says it all, it will change your behavior for ever. The most useless banking institution in the world. One cannot manage your accounts via the app and there is no one to contact to complete changes on your account. The bank is so ashamed of the service it delivers, thus no contact details to mail a query. There is only a call center number, who will intern supply you with no assistance, but give you an email address to mail your query to. When you follow up on your query you will be informed of the email address and be requested to mail another query, and so the endless loop of incompetence continues. They have a turn around time of 3-5 working days which leaves much to be desired. Do not leave your reputable banking institution for this circus,.......",1
