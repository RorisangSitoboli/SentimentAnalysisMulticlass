"Having been an assitant intermediary for the group in the past and seeing how much effort it's been to get the promise fulfilled, I am questioning whether it's worth it to remain a client. In the event of a claim, will my experience be like this too?

I joined during the 10 year anniversary promotion wherein if I obtained gold status on Vitalitydrive in the 3 months after joining I'd get 50% of 6 months' premiums paid back to me. I met this requirement and some.

We're well over 8 months in now and I am still being told of escalations that haven't taken place or that have been ignored by the finance department.

As someone who has worked in client service for several years it makes me sad that this is the kind of service one receives. It takes a lot away from the brand and makes one question all the referrals they have given. 

A bit of background:

I've called on 9 December 2021 at 18h04 and missed you, fair enough.

1) 10 February 2022 at 14h18 (19 minute call with Thobeka, which I later found out was a waste of time because my query wasn't even attended to, never mind escalated like she said it would be)

2) 17 February 2022 at 14h40 for 9 minutes where I was told my query was being escalated to the finance for payment (on day 7 of the 5-10 working day period during which I should have received payment). 

3) 23 February 2022 at 10h53 during which I was told by Mota that I indeed qualified for the refund and it would be processed and paid to me before the week was out and today (which is when the 'week is out') I am told it should have been released already but it hasn't.

My ask is this: when you need to collect premiums, you do not hesitate yet, when you need to do the honourable thing, the client has to raise the issue of your breach and then follow-up numerous times for you to fulfill your promise.

I told the last 2 consultants i spoke to that this review would be my last resort because I hold this company in high regard and I've given you the benefit of the doubt but now I feel I'm being treated like I don't matter.

Please let me know if I am being unreasonable and asking for more than what was promised by you.",1
"I would like to say big up to Mathibedi Cheue, on an awesome experience and professionalism throughout our engagement, he is a star.",5
We have been robbed at knifepount while being tied up for 4 hours in October last year.  Our car was taken as well. 4 months later the car is written off while we are still paying insurance.  All jewellery was taken from the safe with the valuation certificates for which we could provide photographs.  Discovery will not pay out more than R3000 per item.  The communication is pathetic.  To find out who is dealing with your claim is one thing.  To get hold of that person takes hours.   Most of the time they are not at their desks.  In the meantime your call is placed on hold just to be cut off.,5
Yandiswa at the Discovery Insure call centre was absolutely amazing! My broker messed up my quote and COC and Yandiswa literally saved the day! Thank you!,5
"I was stuck on the N1 going south right after picking up my daughters from school, called Discovery, a lady by the name Aretha Tobias from the Emergency Services department and they sent a Tow truck with an emergency fuel 

The assistance was there in less than 45 minutes",5
"Thank you Hloni for your exceptional client experience, Your industry knowledge and expertise is surpassed only by your exceptional client service and outstanding communication skills. You are an asset to the Building Claims team and should be commended. Its a joy working with you. I look forward to having you appointed to my next building claim.",5
"How does discovery justify two increases a month a part ? 
How do they calculate there increases which are way above inflation? 
When I started with discovery at the end of the first year they gave me an increase of 21% . I sold the vehicle got another another vehicle now this year they giving me an increase on the 1st of  March called the annual increase and I got a letter yesterday saying die to the economy and other stories I will get another increase . 
I called them today and nobody can tell me what the second increase will be . This is pathetic and beyond acceptable .",5
"To whom it may concern

A client of Discovery Insure damaged my car by reversing onto my car and drove off.
I managed to track the client down through the SAPS. The client thereafter lodged a claim with discovery.
I sent through all required documents to Discovery, and they got a company to assess my vehicle after receiving the documents.
Once the assessment was done, Nonhlanhla Sinthumule requested banking details to make payment for the damage, which was sent to her.
After a week, she sends me an email stating the claim has been rejected due to outstanding documents which she never requested, how is that even possible
She did not carry out her job properly, furthermore it was Discovery client negligence which caused the damage.
Can I get some feedback on this claim as Nonhlanhla Sinthumule just does not respond to any emails as she is so incompetent.

"On the 21st January 2022, I was involved in a collision on M2 Johannesburg. The matter was reported to the Authorities. I have my case number. The Opposite party who was the client for Discovery insure, accepted his fault and assured me that my vehicle will be repaired by his insurance company.
I have been trying to phone Discovery insure for over a month now, but all in vain. The only response I get from them is that one of their agents will call me and I should wait. It's over a month now and I am unable to drive my car. I was not at fault and yet I must suffer so long to have my car repaired.
Please assist",1
Rakesh Raju is an absolute star. He handles queries with professionalism and is always friendly. He is an absolute star and an asset to the team! THANK YOU,5
"I was insured by Discovery Insure. I was involved in a head on collision on 30 January 2022.  The premium for Feb 2022 was deducted even though the car was already in the s**** yard. To date, it has cost me time and effort to get to arrange  for documents and the key to be collected. Being transferred from one department to another while being cut off. I was not even contacted by Discovery on the accident. I'm not confident that I will use this company ever again. How long will it take before this claim will be finalized. Customer service = NON EXISTING. I have now been notified daily to take my car to Tiger Wheel and Tyres to check on the advice. Surely on your system it should display that this car was in an accident. I have not received my rebate for January 2022.",3
I received the most awesome service from Mathibedi Chueu. He is a total champ super friendly and really helpful .,5
"This review is for the exceptional service delivered by Lucky Mashaba.

He was just super. In resolving a query I had regarding my IFA account payout, he demonstrated patience with me and a desire to understand my concerns in order to help. Not only that, he called back. This follow through alone sets him apart.

I hope his contribution to Discovery Insure is recognized and that he excels.",5
"I have a personal belief that Discovery is one of the best insurers out there. But dealing with my claim has truly been the worst experience of my entire life. On the 31st of January 2022, I had an incident regarding my home and content items. I logged the claim and understood that turnaround times can vary from 2-3 days. After a week of nothing happening, I then call the claims department to understand where we are in the claim, to understand if there is something outstanding or just in general are there discrepancies in my claim that need to be re-looked at. Eventually, I finally speak to a Desktop Assessor and this time I am confident that we are moving forward with my claim. 

Week 1 ends: Nothing happens
Week 2 ends: Nothing Happens
Week 3 - after multiple mails and me sending and communicating as much needed supporting information as possible, a claims person calls me, reassures me that I will receive either a Makro or Takealot Voucher. But as the phone call ensues, she then says ""actually it looks like there is a claims partner, they will be in contact with you"". I replied, ""Alright, thank you"". 

Week 3 ends and I decide to call the specified claims partner because I believe in giving everyone the benefit of the doubt. The service provider then confirms that Discovery Insure communicated to them that they need to put my claim on hold. 

Simply put: despite all my efforts of effective communication and transparency, Discovery Insure doubled down on their lack of efforts to try and help me. 

Here are the facts: 
1) I have actively been forth-coming with all information requested
2) I have maintained the highest form of professional communication as personally do not believe in raising voices or use of adversarial wording when communicating with fellow professionals
3) I have actively followed up each week to try and understand where we are in the process and was continuously reassured ""We will replace your device, it has been approved""
4) My claims dashboard shows that nothing has been authourised and no one has explained to me why that is the case
5) We are now on week 4 and my claim is no where near resolution. 
6) I have personally called the claims number provided and after waiting and completing all the in-call USSD requests, I get put on hold then the phone drops. 

If Discovery Insure is denying my claim, then lets take active steps to try and understand WHY THAT IS HAPPENING. Hell Infact, Even if they are willing to double down, At least tell me that my claim has been denied. We are now sitting on Day 25 of the claim not being resolved. Why is any of this happening?",1

"Nonhlanhla Sinthumele is the worst employee to deal with at Discovery insure third party claims department. She doesn't take calls nor return them. She doesn't even respond to emails.

Last night my car broke down,  I got out and locked myself out of the car, called Discovery insure from a friend's phone. The assistance was super quicker and I am super grateful. Zunaid from Insure 24 made this painless. Thank you",5
Roberta Solomon is the worst person to speak to if you have a claim.she never returns calls or emails until you complain to a senior. I can't believe discovery can take over 5 days to settle a cellphone claim for a business client. There are many other insurers that settle something like this in a day or 2! service is horrible!,1
"Michaela Mc Pherson is an amazing servicing consultant , 

she made a promise to call a client after hours as requested and kept that promise. 
booking was made with the client and her service was very friendly 

thank you so much Michaela",5
"I refuse to believe that a company as big as Discovery does not have an effective customer service department, I am not certain why I am experiencing such horrible service from them. I have about 4 products with Discovery and have serviced them very well but Discovery hasnt kept to their end of the bargain. My attempt to add a fifth service was blatantly ignored, when I called to follow-up and also update one of my covers the consultant dropped and never bothered to return the call, I was already authenticated and he had all my details. Thank God for Outsurance's amazing customer service I was able to get the cover I wanted. I have checked the App for a place where I can request for a callback to update my cover and did not find any and since my attempts to communicate with Discovery through their website and call center yielded no positive results I was left with no choice but to write this review. Discovery needs to do better in their responses, especially to their existing clients.",2
I called in to the Retentions department at Discovery Insure just before 6pm to get assistance with an urgent review and I was lucky enough to get Tasmina Nair who not only assisted me with the 1 case but also offered to call me back and assist me with a few other plans as well since I am working from home. I am so grateful and appreciate your help and friendly attitude. Best call today. Thank You Tas.,5
It is awesome to have work with someone like Natasha Johnston the work is done 100% and there is no come backs. She is also friendly when she speaks to you and very helpful.  It is a blessing to have someone like Natasha,5

"OK so end last year I submitted a claim waited almost 3 weeks.no one contacted me I did all the phoning on my acount.
Submitted a claim yesterday 22Feb submitted all paperwork on morning 23Feb and just no one contacts you back.
Worst service ever think they should stick to medical aid only",1
"I've been insured with Discovery since April 2019. I had zero excess and my premiums were kept at reasonable amount. In December 2020 my vehicle was unfortunately stolen (with the discovery tracker inside). I then purchased a new vehicle and they introduced an excess to my policy, understandably so. 

However since then, my premiums have been increasing at an unacceptable rate especially considering that the risk profile of my current vehicle is lower than that which was stolen. Discovery is punishing me for an incident which I had no control over; I was not negligent (I still have both keys for the vehicle that was stolen), I had never claimed before or been in an accident whatsoever, what else could I have done to avoid thieves stealing my car?

I called Discovery pleading with them to consider not raising my premium but I was met with coldness and there was just no willingness to try and understand my case. I have never missed a premium or been late with payments. Why am I being punished? what else could I have done? At this rate I might as well purchase a second vehicle as insurance instead of being exploited by Discovery.",2

"Jabulile Shiba was friendly and professional. She communicated well, and she made sure that I was assisted timeously. I am grateful that Discovery Insure was there when I needed them.",5
"I see the trend with Discovery it to only respond when you complain via Hello Peter, because their complaints department is useless! I reported an accident 21 Dec 2021, and still do not have my car back due to their slow customer service. I thought by paying for premium service I would be getting premium customer service, but clearly not the case here. At this point I just want this process to be concluded so I can take my business elsewhere and know that I'm paying for what I'll be getting!",1
"I'm so annoyed ! I met up in an accident on the 25th of January 2022 . My car was towed away to the nearest panel beating shop , I waited I think two weeks for them to tell me what was going on with regards to my car , whether it was going to be written off or repaired . They got back to me and told me that it was going to be written off and they need a settlement letter from the bank as this car was still under finance . So the very same day I called the bank and I was able to get the settlement letter , I sent it to the claims handler her name is Yolande Markham . I stated in my email that this letter is going to expire please can you let me know what's going to happen . A whole week went by , I'm calling non stop with my own airtime because nobody is getting back to me . My broker has even been quiet,  unless I call that's the only time I hear from them . So last week I get an email from another claims handler telling me that the letter is expired and she's going to request for another one . So I called into discovery requesting to speak to her they said she's on another call . The lady I spoke to says to me can assist and asked me what's the problem.  So I asked her to please request that settlement asap so this settlement can be done , because take note it's February the 25th is on Friday and I'm going to be paying for a car that I don't even have . If I don't sit on these peoples backs how long is this going to go on . She says to me while she's on the phone that she's doing it and it should come within the next day which was this Saturday the 19-02-2022 . And I asked her are you sure you don't want me to request this settlement letter myself rather to make things faster she says no mam we have a system that requests these letters for us . Today my brok3 FGRo calls me to ask me what's the latest with my claim . (They asking me ) yet it should be the other way around . The lady asked me where's my car , I said I don't know . You guys should be the ones telling me . Then she says okay I'll call you back she calls discovery.  Then she calls me back to tell me that I need to request a settlement letter because the one they have is expired.  Yet I asked this woman last week must I do it . So now what must happen ? I'm very angry . My courtesy car is going back to Avis on the 25th and I still don't know what's going on with this settlement and I must still pay for the car which is smashed and written off . I would like some assistance please because I believe my claims handler Yolande Markham is on leave.",1
"I would just like to express the disappointment I experienced with Discovery Insure. They are too quick to sell their product as the best, and tell you all about their great benefits. But when it comes to claiming, they are just slow. It took more than a week for them to authorise a claim that we submitted. Over and above that another week and half later, where they took our car for repairs, they are saying they have not even started to fix the car. Mind you, a courtesy car is only for 30 days. So basically after the 30 days, Discovery Insure would still have not repaired our car. To add on to our frustrations, the claims consultant (Kabelo Chidi) never updates us on the progress, and when you do contact him/her, they never respond to our query. What is the point of having some being allocated to assist us but they never bother to contact or even respond to us.",1
Always receiving great services from MATHIBEDI CHUEU from the retentions department.,5
"We received quotation on Thursday 17, 2022.We went for a accesment on damages on our vehicle. After that they gave us a quotation. After receiving the quotation they informed us that we will wait 48 hours for the panelbeaters to inform us to bring the vehicle in. Until now no feed back or no one contacted us. My wife had to call in 22, 02, 2022 and the excuse was that the panelbeaters do not have the equipment to do the repairs on the vehicle. This is poor customer service.

"Discovery Insurance is inaccessible .I am an existing client with Discovery.It would be interesting to see if others are experiencing my problem.I have sent two separate emails to quote for a new vehicle but have received no response.If new business is inaccessible what happens in emergencies like accidents?How is the management in this critical department allowing this unacceptable service in this current economic climate?

"I feel I need to write this review, Discovery Insure have redeemed themselves, a week or so ago I wrote a review complaining about how Discovery Insure was offering me poor service- to repair a cellphone screen. The process between registering the claim and having the device booked in for repairs was extremely long and the communication was poor from Discovery’s side. I submitted the claim online on the 19th of January, finally could drop the device on the 5th of February for repairs, I did drop the device at one of their service providers.
How they have redeemed themselves is that after the cellphone repair company gave them feedback that they are waiting for parts which could take 3-6 weeks to arrive, Discovery decided on their own that they would much rather pay me out for the device retail value than have me wait that long for a device - I thought this was very thoughtful & considerate of them. They promised to pay out within 72hours.",4
"It was an absolute pleasure dealing with Jabulile Shiba, totally professional and the best customer service ever I experienced from Discovery Insure. It started with understanding my situation, advising and communicating regularly to provide me with a customer service second to none.

I have been trying to log a claim for 2 days. **********I get through and get cut off. After 3 tries of getting cut off I finally got hold of a human and it was for car insurance she then moved me on and I held on the line for 11 minutes and got cut off again. I tried to use the complaints online but its for medical aid complaints not home insurance complaints. I cannot log a claim online via the app like Discovery claims as it only allows me to log vehicle claims. This has not been fixed. Discovery how do I get hold of you. Your advertised methods don't work at all. My broker is not responding either so what now?,1
"Discovery is just a name and high installments that rise every year, their customer service and communications are great but honestly I'm in the process of leaving discovery for good. I feel very unsafe and don't get piece of mind. My claim wasn't paid off in the past and I was left to do everything myself and it was an extremely large sum of money taht has changed my life. I feel with discovery if you don't read through your contracts and terms and agreements and conditions you will be fooled. Their are alot of Grey areas and they are very smart when it comes to how they will not be able to cover you. They are very risky and to be honest I have a health plan and medical aid as well as car insurance but Im moving away because they good at finding reasons to charge more or to promote new products and make everything look very enticing with classy advertising but from my experience I feel afraid like thee is a reason they could use against me to not cover me yet I get calls every week for new products or raises... This is just how I feel and it really troubles me..",1

Netassess did a pathetic job by listening to me and compiling a report without doing their own investigation. After more than 8 years with Discovery, this is it. I’m cancelling my policy with this provider. 

Any great insurance service providers out there willing to scoop a new client?",1
"Discovery Insure worst service ever!!! Accident happened 20th January and on the 22nd February the car remains untouched (40K bumper bashing) - approved claim - as a supposed premium insurer the communication and feed back is pathetic. Customers are willing to pay a premium for a premium service, yet when I insist that my out of warranty BMW gets repaired by a BMW approved repair center, it falls out of their policy; implying that they are OK with non BMW parts being fitted to the car just because it is out of warranty???   no response on complaints email's sent; being put on hold for 20min at a time; being cut off whilst hanging on! What type of organisation is this...exit this space and rather focus on medical aid then - very disappointed loyal Discovery client",1

I have always been a loyal customer, with all the Discovery products. I can’t believe something so simple takes so long to resolve.",1
I have a claim with Discovery Insure. They do not respond. This is the 2nd complaint in a year with regards to claiming. There is no feedback on emails or telephone calls and you actually have to beg Discovery to respond and they still dont. You should think very carefully if you require insurance with Discovery.,1
"The worst insurance company ever.

I made a windscreen claim on 07 November 2021, a windscreen replacement. It's 22 February 2022, the windscreen has not been replaced. I have been with Discovery for over 4 years, my premium is ridiculously high, ( yet the car value has depreciated) half my car installment. for such a high premium one would expect 5-star treatment, but no. I am highly disappointed with the service at the Insure call center, they will make you hold until THEY hang up on you. 

DO NOT INSURE WITH DISCOVERY GOOD PEOPLE!!!!",1

I have been with discovery insure for just over 4 years now. I must say that the decision to join this group was the best decision i ever made regards to my insurance needs.

"I would like to express my greatest disdain with the service I have received from discovery insure after my accident. Dismal follow ups or none at all, third parties calling me upset because discovery doesn’t follow up with them. I had to deal with an angry third party because of discovery’s lack of admin. I myself had issues regarding the booking of my vehicle, confirmation of calls that needed following up from their side. I might just as well have done everything myself. I will tell everyone asking me about my experience about discovery insure at my business. I feel that I need compensation for this lackluster service I pay for every month, big corporates eat your money but don’t deliver. South Africans easily point fingers at government for taking money and not delivering service, but Discovery is even worse, does the same under the banner of private business. Absolutely appalling.",1
Excellent service from Kirk Desai from the retentions department with consist feedback and updates.,5
I was very impressed with the service I received from William Machitiso at discovery insure. He was very helpful and made sure to keep me updated and also checked up on me to make sure my case was seen to and that I received the service I was promised. Every company needs a William.,5
"Thank you to Discovery for making good on the tow and recovery service that they offer as part of my car insurance policy. Stuck in a rut in rural South Africa I was able to get good assistance at the call centre and though the process took longer than  expected, due to a terrible storm and an intermittent network signal, I appreciate that Discovery ladies kept communication going via Watsapp. The towing company and its truck drivers were polite and professional.  I thank you.",5
"Discovery Insurance is definitely the worst Insurance I've had,first they rejectes a claim on my vehicle for a part that they said I must get second hand and now I've got a claim on 2 phone screens and they don't even come back to you.They never mis a debit order and are very quick to put there premiums up,I wil definitely not recommend Discovery Insurance to any one.",1
"Sick and tired of false promises. 

Honestly, I think the 'product' is fantastic and really offers a lot with the Vitality drive if you drive well, but I am REALLY unhappy with the 'service' I am receiving from Insure - or whatever department my query keeps getting sent to without response.

Been waiting over a month for money to be paid back to me for a car seat I bought through the Car Seat partner using my Vitality Drive discount. My initial discount voucher did not adequately reflect the discount I qualified & I was told to submit the receipt to Discovery for refund. Since, I've had at LEAST 3 consultants who have PROMISED to call me back & sort out the issue, have emailed them, phoned them & threatened to review them here - and nothing. 

I keep using up my airtime waiting on the phone to follow up & receive more promises from someone else - only to get a different excuse as to which department is at fault and why it wasn't processed correctly and that the matter has been 'escalated' again (it's been escalated at least 3 times??) and that I will get a call back the same day for feedback - followed every time by no response and me needing to call back once more. 

I sent an email to Insure containing these concerns mentioned above & that I am soon going to review like this on HelloPeter - only to receive communication that they will be in touch and still have not been. 

I really should not have to fight like this to get a refund for something that was a Discovery Insure System error in the first place!!",1

Thank you Kirk De Sai for your professionalism and effeciency with canceling my policy.,5
"So on the 29th January 2022 i experienced a leak whereby the water was dripping from the bathroom which is above the kitchen onto the building cupboards, it being a Saturday someone by the name of Busisiwe explained to me that its the weekend and it will be difficult to get a plumber which I understood and she said on Monday someone will come out. I took off on the Monday from work and no one called or came out, i sent her an email with zero response. Late Tuesday afternoon the plumbers called and said they can only come on Wednesday. They came around late Wednesday afternoon and upon checking advised they do not know if the leak is underneath the bath or if its the sealant. They said they do not want to break unnecessary walls to see if it is a leak underneath the bath but instead will seal the bath and I must check to see if it worked. They left and the Thursday i emailed Busisiwe again asking for feedback and she said she is awaiting the report to give authorizationfor the repair, i advised her that its going in for a week and there is just so much i can do to avoid the leak damaging my built in cupboards. The Friday she advised other plumbers will come out which the plumbers called and said they can only come on Saturday and only book me to be fixed the following week, i advised Busisiwe again that we can go with the first plumbers because both will only be able to fix it the following week so its pointless. Now where the problem starts is that on the 7th February ONLY then authorization was given and they only came out the 9th to come seal the bath. After sealing the bath the leak stopped and an assessor was sent out to check for the damage who then reported that according to him the building cupboards is very old and he can't distinguish if its water damage because of the leak or years of wear and tear. Discovery rejected the claim and said it was q maintenance issue and according to team leader Unica who has a terrible attitude for a title as team leader told me Discovery met me halfway by paying for the sealant athough it was a maintenance issue and their specialist said the leak has been going on for months and possibly years therefore the cupboards is damaged. I told her for a leak to happen I'm sure over the years i would have noticed the cupboards are damp or wet and although I am not disputing the maintenance finding, i am disputing the fact that Discovery took 5 days to get a plumber to me whilst my cupboards was getting wet and i did everything by limiting the damage by placing towels etc while i was waiting for Discovery. I even emailed Busisiwe numerous times asking her why is it taking so long for plumbers to come out but most if the tomes i received no reply and was never kept updated. What shocked me was that the plumbers called me to update me on my claim but not Discovery. I said that Discovery must take some sort of responsibility for taking so long to get plumbers out because if they came out the Monday and gave their findings i would have been more than happy to pay for the sealant but instead they took 2 weeks to fix this and the plumbers themselves was not sure if it is the sealant or a leak underneath the bath but basically tried the sealant first because its easier. I expected Discovery regardless if it was wear and tear and maintenance issue based in the sealant to replace my building cupboards because they took almost 2 weeks to get this sorted and fixed. If the initial report said it was maintenance then why pay for the sealant and nit reject the claim and tell me I need to seal the bath but instead they paid for the sealant because they weren't too sure either. I explained all this to Unica and she showed zero empathy or even understanding what im trying to say and just said my claim is rejected bit taking into account how long i had to wait and how many times i had to follow up and ask when the plumbers will be arriving.  She basically also said in many words that its pointless of me arguing but nothing is going to change and she still stands by the decision of the claim being rejected and won't change it and any future damage to the cupboards will not be covered because of this and the cupboards being old. At this point i was fuming because she even gave me wrong dates about the authorization even though I told her i have proof it was only given on the 7th which is 10 days after the claim was registered but she still said its pointless because it's rejected. I told her as a client of Discovery that always kept you to a high standard i was shocked at her rude response to me as a client and im actually at a point of cancelling all my products with discovery namely my medical aid, buildings insurance, home contents insurance, life policies, vehicle insurance etc and going somewhere else where i feel more valued as a client and where im treated with empathy and respect and whats even more shocking to me was her response of ""okay sure"". From my household you are receiving in excess of 13k a month from me which is not a lot of money for Discovery but its a lot of money for me as an individual to give out but i do not mind giving out such an amount due to the fact of having an expectation of great service which i always received from you and always recommended you to all my family, friends and work colleagues but after this experience and the way Unica treated me i will take my money and go somewhere where my needs from an insurer is met because having been with you for many years you let me down BIG TIME. So you willing to lose a customer which gives you over 13k a month for an amount of approximately the same to replace my cupboards and take responsibility of the delay and inconvenience. Guess they always say, as a company becomes bigger they start losing their main focus which was customer satisfaction and start focusing only on profits. I would appreciate it if a manager and not a team leader can give me a call because it will really be very disappointing for me to leave you guys whom i always recommended to everyone to go to one of your competitors where to be honest i do not want to go but as a client of Discovery i do not feel appreciated at this moment.",1
"After a great experience with you replacing my iPhone this week, I am very disappointed in your consultants and Online Vault. I cannot upload proof of ownership for my iPhone, my fiance's phone and my engagement ring. The website does not allow me to save the documents. I have tried on different devices and browsers. I have asked since 3rd January for a consultant to upload them for me. i have emailed countless times. My biggest concern is that if something happens to those things, you will not pay because YOUR vault doesnt work., The last consultant was so rude to me and actually said it is ""impossible"" for it to not upload because there is no error message but there is very clearly an error in the coding of your website. I even offered to take a video so she could see what I did but she was not interested. I am very scared to know that I might not be covered because of something that is not my fault and I would like to make it clear that should any future claims be denied because of YOUR faulty website, I will take all manner of legal action since my emails and instructions have been ignored for almost two months. KINDLY UPLOAD ALL MY PROOFS OF OWNERSHIP AS I KEEP REQUESTING",2
"The service is so terrible. I am actually going to cancel my insure policy. I phoned on Tuesday at 12:32 pm and was on hold for 13 minutes. After holding for such a long time, my query was not resolved. Today I have been holding for 15 minutes and still, my query has not been resolved. I called at 1418hrs. My email to insuremaintainance written on the 27 of January has not been responded to. Your service is ****ed up and frustrating. I just wanted to know why I have not been receiving my cashback? If a consultant calls and dangles the cash back, please do not take the bait.",1

"We had a break in the early hours of morning and we have spend hours trying to get Discovery Insure to help us with the claim and sorting out all the damage so we can be safe tonight, they are non responsive, I have call the centre
8 times was transferred so many times I lost count and spend more 1 and half hours trying to get hold of them and get feedback, we managed to get. A claim lodged however they promised to call back in 5 mins to give feedback on the gate and garage door, it’s been hours and no one is willing to help, the contact number on the claims consultants email is for discovery health, OBVIOUSLY there are No managers available!! 

The last lady I was transferred too after being transferred about 4 or 5 times said let me try help, I had to tell the whole story again, probably the 12th time, her response and why to help me is I must find someone myself and do it myself?!!!!????? 

I was extremely rude and said then why the F do we pay you, she said she is not taking my abuse and put the phone down??? 

I have been begging for help!! There is absolutely no accountability, no empathy and just NO INTEREST in assisting us at all I even went to Fb messager and they have gone quiet!!!! 

We have both our life insurance with discovery all our short term insurance, our medical aid, and just  understand why we can’t get decent service when we need it when the rubber hits the road is when the claim comes in the thing we pay for? And you failed again!! 

A person is alway traumatized and violated but I feel more angry with how you are treating us right now!!!!!",1
"When I joined Discovery Insure last year. I made it quite clear that I want insurance on my car and house contents.  Yesterday my tv was damaged with this bad weather that we had.  This morning when I phoned them, I was told by an agent that my house contents was cancelled last year November.  When I asked her who cancelled it, her reply was, I don't know.  How is that possible, I did not cancel it.  All emails that I send to them, just get answered with a ""Thank you for your email, a consultant will get back to you"".  They never do.  I keep on asking for my insurance policy, but once again nothing. There service is pathetic. What if my house was broken into in December, and all my possessions stolen.",1
"One star is 100% higher rating than deserved.  My claim with Discovery was lodged 12 Dec 2021.  Two months and 1 week later, we still cannot get answers out of Discovery.  Water damage to the concrete slab, a bathroom that cannot be used.  No feedback, no communication.  I called  the Call centre today after they have sent yet another person to come to our property (think this was nr 5) to write yet another report last week Thursday.  Today I have to hear the quote originally supplied (by plumbers sent out by them) and the Quote received last week is different and the last one is higher (done by person nr 5 sent by them) and now they still have no answer.  Maybe it is time to sort your internal issues and processes first. 
Other issues that I never received answers on
1)  Moved houses, changed my address only and Discovery conveniently removed my house content insurance.  I was uninsured on home content for months....
2) I was charged a Financial advisor fee without having a financial advisor, no feedback, they have no record of it and want me to proof it.....
3) TV claim took almost a month.  TV and apple TV was replaced as it could not be repaired.  Months later someone logged in from the unrepairable apple tv on my account from Durban?
Think I have been Patient for long enough with a don not care attitude.",1
"Discovery Insure
I am reeling at the pathetic condition that my car was returned to me. I had an accident and they sent a tow truck that towed the vehicle to a different location than the call centre agent informed me off. My car was then tampered with Amp stripped, everything inside shifted and moved and tampered with. Scratches on the door. I was devasted upon receiving my vehicle. I only had a bust radiator  but my car returned worse off. I contacted discovery to report this but no response. I am shocked disgusted and do not advise anyone to take out insurance with these guys. Their premiums are high and for what? I could of fixed this myself and saved myself the heart ache of a mangled car. They also managed to ""lose"" my car for a few days. No straight answers no responses. I just don't know what to do so I have decided to resort to all social platforms to create awareness to us consumers.",2

"I have been a Discovery Insure member for a long time and recently had to terminate my membership because of the 2022  increases. But for this steep increases, I was very happy with these insurers and they have been treating me well and professionally too. I found myself a new cover where my premium if almost half of what Discovery Insure pay from February 2022. When I phoned to cancel I was assisted by a highly professional lady by the name of Zimkita Sundu in Retentions.. She tried all her best to get my premium reduced and I suspect she is still doing so. Discovery Insure must be keeping a lot of members because of people like Zimkita.  I think that Discovery Insure is retaining and getting more members because of Zim. I wish wherever I am now will get professionals like her. Compassionate, understanding, calm and witty!!",4

He contacted us promptly, was incredibly professional and courteous and was able to provide timelines he could stick to and which we could plan our lives around which is incredibly rare and so valuable in these instances.

Thanks Fabian, you're a star!",5
"If ever a consultant phone's you and tries to convince you to take out Discovery insurance, do not make the mistake to listen to him/her. They mislead you. You will think you are insured like they promised you or like you requested until the time you try to put in an insurance claim. Only then you will find out that you are paying for comprehensive insurance but only have limited insurance. So in fact, they are charging you for a service that you do not receive, I think their promises are more false and fake that those politicians promises before election time. They are quick to put the debit order in place to take your money, but when it is time for them to pay your claim, they use any excuse not to pay.",1

And a Natasja Badenhorst  team leader said they never received the letter. Till today no management had called me. What kind of people are employed at this company.
It’s now going on 3 months and no conclusion. Are guy mute that you can’t speak and deaf that you guys can’t listen also",1

"Best Person by far to deal with is Celeste NDLOVU.  She is an asset to Discovery although I don't think they know that.  Overall my service EXPERIENCE was not so great from previous consultants at Discovery as they had a no-care attitude. Celeste Ndlovu changed my mind in 1 minute flat. She is professional, friendly and knows exactly how to deal with an irate customer that has been pushed from pillar to post. Ask for her by name you won't be disappointed !!!!",5
Superb Servicing. All done in 5 min,5
"So disappointed with Discovery, Join them if you are willing to have your premium increased three times in  Less than 90 days. Here is how they did it: 
1. Jan 2022 R2,226.86 ...what we agreed on at the beginning, Fine!.  
2. Feb 2022 - R2,743,24 ( difference R516,13) they call this mid-term increase,  there was no communication whatsoever they just debited my account. 
3. March R2,867.13 ( I don't understand this one, ""Random increase"" maybe)
4. April 2022 R3,243,36(Difference R376,05 and this is an annual increase).
Total increase R1,016.50. This is just not right. I called them and they can't do anything because of, quote--> ""Several factors affect this, including the rand/dollar exchange rate, general inflation, the cost of labour, and changing weather patterns."" 
LOL, they even blamed the weather. The worse part is, I have to stay with them till May(3years as per agreement conditions) to be able to get my money from IFA account. Yes, the money in the account is more than the combined increase over the period. I can not lose my hard-earned cashback.

My Health insurance, Life Insurance, Vitality, and Banking is with Discovery. I'm sure the increases for those are on the way. This is a major disappointment, not only in the premium increases but the way they conduct business.",1

"I had a bad accident last week. I am insured with Discovery (best move I have ever made), and they called me after the impact first to find out if I was physically OK,  and then to find out if the correct people were there to tow my car. I got a message today to say that the car was assessed yesterday. As per the gent I spoke to, I will probably know the outcome by the end of today. 

I just want to compliment Discovery Insure on having such well-mannered and helpful call-centre agents, the 2 in particular being Gloria and Mpho.

I know these things take time, I'm almost certain the car is a write off, but the service has not disappointed. I will not hesitate to Insure my next vehicle with Discovery again. My son is also due to be getting a little car to learn to drive, and for us to run around in, and I will once again Insure with Discovery. I just want to say thank you. From all the negative feedback I got about being insured with Discovery, I am actually going to make a point of telling those people that my experience with Discovery from the day I insured has been nothing less than fabulous.",5

Discovery Insure makes me proud to say I'm insured with them!",5
"I cant believe im BACK on hellopeter again. This is absolutely ridiculous. Its as though discovery is now punishing me because i have complained. I dont mind simply getting a different insurer but i just need whats owed to me to be paid and i can move on. And the higher you go the worse the service becomes. Today i had a call scheduled with Grant Wills, drops me at the last minute to attend to personal matters, hands me over to his PA who guess what? Also promises me a call and goes awol. A fe weeks ago i dealt with a team leader in client servicing, Thabiso Mahlangu, exactly the same. Promised a call, call never came, a few sweet nothings and emails stopped getting responded to. And it’s impossible to get the people these people report to but im guessing they are even more busy with their kids so surely thats asking for too much.",1
"Involved on mva.
A 70 yr old lady crashes head on to me as she tries to make an illegal right turn causing me to vere and crash into her..
2 weeks had passed and "" if "" I was the defaulting party why didn't your client open an AR.
Why did mother . Son. Daughter law deny the Collison ever occurred 
This is a racist attack
A white company 
A white driver 
And a white assessor who all have failed to report the matter as prescribed by law..
Neither was I contacted by any one person or party  
It's only when I alert the lady when I did get hold of her. She makes no mention of the collision but tells me I need to pay for her car hire only as its used for business..
Her failure to report 
Her insurers failure to contact me
She being aged 71
Their family who denied all knowledge of the incident tells me that they knew the 71 yr old was at fault so they kept quiet meaning , they were guilty and were avoiding me.
But when I get all details and call the insurer. It's only then do they attack me miming me as the defaulting driver.

"On the 20th DECEMBER 2021 my wife had driving through accident debris and our range rover rear tyre was slashed, by a metal object damaging a small section of fender and tail gate panel as this object propelled in the air. The tyre was totally damaged leaving a section of titanium wheel rim damaged. the fender and tailgate damages are minor, however the panels needs to be resprayed. This is the very first claim we had with DISCOVERY INSURE for ±5 years and what a real BAD EXPERIENCE. We have 3 luxury vehicles insured with them and have paid our premiums timorously, however the competency levels of their staff is pathetic. We received an agreement of loss to sign for the 1 new tyre and repair of the rim (INCORRECT SPECS QUOTED ON) as they excluded the fender and tail gate panel repair. We have furnished them with video footage photographs and quotations as we therefore did not want to sign the agreement of loss doc. Guess what the following day we where paid out for the tyre and rim (NOT THE CORRECT SPEC) without any signature to their Agreement of loss. We have been since communicating with team leaders who had promised us the world to get this mess sorted out and today had no response from anyone via email or telephonically. Discovery services sucks and is very dissapointing as there is no synergy between the AD campaign and the way they treat their clients. We have been patient enough as this matter will be escalated to the OMBUDSMAN.",1
"Hi. If there was a zero rating option available I would have picked that one. I canny describe the incompetence and diabolical service I have recieved from Discovery Insure. I had an accident on the 17th December while I was in the middle of my holiday. Road side assist does not exist with Discovery when it's not in a city centre. I somehow managed to get my car to Paarl where I had to book my own rental vehicle! My vehicle was only picked up by discovery for assessment 2 weeks after the accident. My vehicle is still sitting in Cape Town - 2 months after my accident...I think this must be a practical joke. Discovery then approved half of the repairs based on an initial assessment, but when the second assessment revealed more damages they are declining further damage repairs...its 2 months now since my accident and today I was asked by discovery to fly down to Cape Town to sign off the half finished repairs, pay my excess and then miraculously drive my still broken vehicle back to JHB. I am gob smacked at Discovery's lack of integrity, I'm speechless and I am hand cuffed....

We have been with Discovery insure for many years and have enjoyed the product and fuel spend cash back. We had one or 2 small bumps and at the time found their consultants friendly and helpfull. On the 7th of Feb i had bad water damage to a vehicle and submitted the claim. Since then we are trying to get the claim to move along but get no communication unless we call. Our mails remain unanswered for days. We are finding this process extremely frustrating and we are considering moving all our products away from Discovery.,1

"Ever since I got a car in 2015, I have never had a claim. I got into a pothole on the 18th of December, my car was towed to East London, since now I haven't my car yet. The Panel Beaters are telling this and that. It's been 2 months now, I'm sure it's going to month 3. I am so frustrated and stressed. The claim consultant is not giving me any feedback about my car. I have children that goes to school, I don't have a car, where as I'm paying for insurance. It seems like Discovery does not care about their clients. I'm in Cape Town, I don't know when I will get my car. I'm stressed. This is not on. This is so unfair.",1

"We are loyal Discovery clients and have most of their product offerings. 

As such we are utterly disappointed with how long it has taken to resolve an issue regarding a claim logged early January 2022. 

We verbally received confirmation of payment of x amount from our brokers for our lapa which was damaged due to JHB storms. We opted for a payout as we did not want thatch lapa replacement and communicated as such to our broker. Long story short we were  fortunate enough to note the discrepancy on the ‘pay out’ form and the settlement amount was R10000 less than what was verbally communicated to us. 

We raised the discrepancy with our broker and since then we are  now in limbo for close to 7 weeks for resolution on the matter.

We are constantly now the one’s chasing for answers and response and it is quite sad that in addition to suffering the damage to our property we are now dealing with claim drama in having our settlement paid out.

Utterly disappointed, irritated and annoyed and we will definitely be looking at moving from Discovery Insure abs are seriously considering moving all our other products from Discovery",2
Please do not use Discovery. When they started out over 20 years ago they begged me to take them on as an insurer. Today I can't even get hold of them to replace a simple window that's cracked. Their website is useless and keeps freezing or kicking you off. They provide no direct line for communication and are deliberately ambiguous. Since they became a monopoly they are beyond useless. Let the buyer beware. Imagine having to trust this company with your life in a medical emergency. No thanks,1
Shamanie Naidoo from the retention's department is always willing to help and very friendly. Keep it up!,5
"Thank you Natasha for an awesome service, so bubbly and ready to help...
Thanks you so very much ....if it were by me I would ask to speak to you whenever I call the call centre..",5

I had bought a new vehicle and needed to get insurance sorted on it. I am a dedicated Discovery client as all my policies are with them. After Shafick Allow assisted with keeping me in the group I was extremely satisfied with the level of service I received from him.,5

"I was a victim of an iPhone theft on Friday and I was so traumatised. My claims consultant, Wendy (I think her first name is Ntokozo) Radebe treated me like royalty. She processed my claim and because I am so pedantic about my phone, made sure I got a voucher so that I could order the color of my choice and also replace my very expensive case. Wendy, you made me feel like the most important person in the world today, and I cannot thank you enough. I should be back online in a few with a new iPhone, all thanks to you. Thank you for being so kind and caring. Thank you Discovery for having my back. You will have me as a customer for life.",5
"I was in a car accident on Christmas Day and was initially super impressed with Discovery Insure and my case handler, Abobaker Williams. All queries were attended to promptly and the process seemed to run as smoothly as I could ever have hoped for. I was so impressed that when Abobaker asked me to write him a review on here, I jumped at the opportunity and wrote a glowing review, mentioning him by name. If only I had known that that would be where the support stopped!

I have to date not been able to get my car repaired. Abobaker only provided me with one option for a repairer who only has a slot for me in March - THREE MONTHS after the accident! When I brought this to his attention, he said he would contact the assessor and see whether they have any other repairers. This was almost two weeks ago. I have chased numerous times for an update with no response from Abobaker. I have asked for the complaints procedure and I'm still being completely ignored. At this point, there is literally no way for me to have my car repaired as the Discovery representative has seemingly decided Discovery does not want me as a customer anymore. I don't know what to do, and I don't know why I bother paying my premiums if Discovery is refusing to have my car fixed in a non-fault claim? 

I am so disappointed in the way this has transpired. It seems Abobaker was only eager to help me until I wrote him a good review on Hellopeter, and then all service and assistance ceased. I am strongly considering just taking my business elsewhere, as clearly Abobaker Williams and Discovery Insure do not care about me as a paying customer.",1
"I have just switched to Discovery insure about 3 months ago and now I have had the  worst experience dealing with a simple cellphone screen repair claim. I wish I can go back to my old insurer.
Firstly one is unable to get hold of any claim consultants on the phone, I have literally been on hold for 30 minutes with no help.
I dropped the cellphone to their service provider over a week ago and I still haven't been contacted to fetch it yet, no communication as to when I can expect the device back.",1
"I submitted a claim for household contents  in January 2022 . One part of it was attended to but the other no response. They called their service provider to collect my microwave for assessment and did not give me feedback. When I called to ask for progress they said they are looking for quotes and will get back to me in 24 hours and that was on 9 February 2022 till today no response. This morning I have wasted more than R100 on the phone more than 5 times my phone has been dropped once I put my ID number. The worse part the claims consultant who was assisting initially is not responding to any email ( Ntlatle Swana). I have never had such a bad customer service and disregarding of clients. They have my broken microwave, my monthly insurance instalments they collect without fail every month and ignores my calls. I thought discovery insure was the best I guess it’s because I never had challenges before now, when you need them there are nowhere to be found",1
I was assisted by Wanda Mdunyelwa from Insure 24 when both my vehicles batteries went flat after an unscheduled and extended out-of-town stay.  The service provider arrived promptly to assist and Wanda checked up to make sure that everything was in order. Great service to resolve a stressful situation.,5
"the escalation person in the claims department does not return nor acknowledges our emails. if we submit claims, it means there is something wrong with our vehicles so we are in distress, the last thing we need is a rude and arrogant person assisting us",1
"I have Discovery car insurance and needed assistance. I've tried to contact you on **********and have been holding the line for 86 minutes & counting. You are of no assistance!

Last night I tried to obtain my policy documents and got referred to the Discovery App and/or your Website. After trying your app, at the page where I'm suppose to download the policy schedule, the app kept on rendering a blank page. Your website asks me to ""select a document"" to download, but nothing is selectable!

How can it be so difficult to reach Discovery Insurance?",1
I wish there was a no star option. I just took out a policy with Discovery Insure a few months back. I have as part of it white insurance. On 21 Jan our dishwasher breaks. I submit my claim via the app. Accoding to their adverts then you claim will be solved within 48 hours. We are now 24 days later. And no reply. I have emailed them several times then I just get a letter telling me they are so sorry that I am unhappy but they will give attention to it in 72 hours. I tried to phone today but after holding on for 15 min I was just cut off. This has been the worse service I ever had! That is why I am now trying Hello Peter,1

"We just want to compliment Mr Riaan Whitney for the excellent and exceptional service he has provided us during our last claim.

The service, professionalism and conduct was by far the best we have received from any assessor so far.
Mr Whitney ensured that the hole process was speedily concluded from the moment he made the assessment, and followed it through until complete.

This is how it is supposed to be done!

Well done and Thank you Riaan! Keep up the good and professional work.",5
"I finished my annual TWT multipoint check in January. Somewhere along the internal Discovery processes, my information was not processed, which resulted in a lower cashback for January as well as a lower percentage. I wrote quite a scathing email as I was very disappointed that I had to send my information through manually after I paid for the inspection and ticked all the boxes.

Nevertheless, Nokukhanya Mthembu and Tsholofelo Makgotlwe picked up my query the next day (on a Saturday) and made the necessary corrections immediately. Thank you so much, you have also corrected my perception and improved my experience of Discovery Insure!",5

"Had a minor accident yesterday evening. I called my car insurer and spoke to Aziz McPherson from Discovery Insure 24. He was very empathetic, respectful and  understanding. He explained everything i needed to know and do and answered all my questions adequately. Brilliant part is that he first enquired whether i was in a safe place, as I woman in this day and age I really appreciated that. Thank you and God bless

"If u are considering discovery  insure please reconsider. I have been insured from last year november and the amount of emails and calls i have had to rectify issues have still not been dealt with. I have 3 cars insured by them and have problems so far with all my claims. Its a nightmare im only having my car fixed now in february after 4 months of issues still not resolved. After fixing my own windscreen because they refused to replace the original glass i ended up paying from my own pocket. Please be very careful when they debit premiums they take off incorrect amounts and refund u much less than owing to u. Also now im waiting for my full refund yet they claimimg that i should pay excess after not having a car for more than 3 months. I drive an automatic car they give me only a 7 day hire on a manual even though i try to negotiate less days to make up for an automatic. They are not flexible, do not compromise and fix ur car the cheapest way. If u driving an expensive car please think again. Discovery insure is definitely not the way to go. Till now having issues with another  unresolved  claim and mu refund. They talk about world class safety features -definitely not so- my merc is still on warranty but discovery refused to replace the original merc glass. Please think carefully before insuring with discovery.",1

Great service from Mathibedi Chueu when cancelling my Discovery Insure policy today. Made the process easy and quick!,5
I have been received the worst service from claims administrator who has failed to communicate all/any vital information regarding my claim. I have called their contact centre various times 20 times or even more. I have escalated to two team leaders but still nothing no joy. Discovery is quick to take my hard earned money every month without fail but the drag their legs when coming to claiming since they are in the business of taking their customer for a ride. Friday is promise day you will be promised & disappointed every Friday.,1

Been trying to resolve the claim since 06 January 2022. Vehicle was a write off, all documents sent over a week ago, was promised settlement by 08 February 2022 after having to wait for over a month. And until today it is still not done. I incur additional costs daily due to your incompetence. Dealt with TL Michael from Claim Specialist Department twice. Very helpful gent however unable to confirm the transaction processed. I require a call back on the number you have on my profile from your finance manager alternatively, this will become a CEO ad Ombudsman complaint.",1

Great service from Willie Scholtz,5
Very appalling service. My vehicle went in for repairs for a small dent on the door its been 8 weeks and I still haven't received my car back. I have contacted discovery and was told I will be called back but nothing. Every time I call I wait on the phone to be put through to claims assessor but the calls always get cut. How do we then speak to anyone?  My consultant Sindy Radebe doesn't respond to my emails and there is no contact number for her. I have contacted Durban Panel Beaters and they always have excuses as to why my car is not ready...this company should not be used by discovery.,1
On the 7th my neighbor house was burnt and effected our side on the monday morning I spoke to David my broker and he advised me I should lof it on the discovery app I did that and was provided a claim no ********** on the 8th the content asses was her her and the evening the building asses was here Athur. Uptil today 5 days later we still have no answer I was sent a email yesterday to say they have escalate the matter but nothing as yet. My window is out my kids are traumatized we could not set our alarm. We have now put in a temporary window in at out cost for safety. Every month a debit order goes off and as soon as something happens we must wait is this the type of service discovery provides to people? Disgusting and I am diffently taking my business else where. I have also send athur my quotes but he also has not communicated with us.,1
Great service from Tasmina Nair  from the retentions department. She is always bubbly and ready to help!,5
Wonderful experience dealing with Mathibedi Thibi Chueu.  He goes the extra mile on difficult queries and is always so upbeat and positive.  A friendly voice on the other side of the line. Star service as usual,5
"We usually have no issues with Discovery insure. But this time was horrible!
1-im still waiting to hear after 2 weeks why my impact alert didnt send an alert or a SOS to Discovery during the accident
2-i had to initiate must communication during the process, like when do I get my car rental, what's the status
3- after 3days, I had to fight to get a car rental. Rental company didn't have cars, but that was apparently my problem, not Discovery's
4- at least I know Discovery and about my excess savers account, was just told to pay excess to the repairers. AGAIN, had to initiate the discussion that I want the money paid from my excess account. 

Even after all of this. The consultant has the audacity to ask me to write a review on Hello Peter! I would have rather just hung my head in shame...

As a ""purple"" client, would really expect more...",1

A big thank you to Zunaid Joseph from Insure 24 who helped me so promptly and professionally today when I panicked with my burst tyre in a dangerous road.

I was forced to put in a claim on the 30th of December 2021 due to a break inn at my house. All my documents where handed in within a reasonable accepted time. The accessor done a fantastic job and all her documents and recommendations where perfect. She sent them through for approval and this is where the **** hit the fan. One month and 10 days later I’m still waiting for the approval. Various e-mails to the person who has to approve it without success or any reply. Escalated it to management and also not even an answer that we will investigate it. Nothing. Everyone seems to be ignoring me. This I never expected of a company like discovery. I had a claim in covid lockdown and within a week all was done and dusted. I for a month and still now don’t have a front door as they also took time to pay this out and now I’m still waiting for my stuff to be replaced and the necessary payments as promised to be made. They sent me a form after me for two weeks laying on them to sign with the assurance that it will take 72 hours from the signing of form to pay out. It’s another week and still nothing. Tom it’s a complaint to the ombudsman for sure.,1
They are very friendly and helpfull and very excited to experience all that they can offer me as their new client,5

"I logged a claim ( no: **********) on 11 Jan 2022, claim was registered with the supplier on the same day. I requested that the windscreen be replaced by the 14 Jan, as i was leaving on a trip. No response received from Discovery. I contacted the supplier and was informed it was impossible, as they needed more time to source an original windscreen. To date (10 Feb 2022) it has not been sorted, or received any further info.

Excellent service from Thandiwe Radebe,5
"Good day, I recently bought a car and decided to use a third party agent to assist me with the change of ownership. On the 28th of January I was hijacked at gunpoint and my vehicle taken from me. I immediately contacted the police and the discovery emergency line. Discovery insure said that I can get trauma counselling for which I was so grateful for as to this day I am still haunted by the ordeal. 
I summitted a claim and then that is when there attitude changed from assistance to frustration. My claim number is **********, I was told asked to deregister the vehicle, so I went to the third party agent to collect my documents to my dismay they had not yet done the change of ownership. I immediately contacted discovery to inform them of the situation they assured me that it will not be an issue and that I should proceed with obtaining the deregistration certificate once I have it I should email it to them with the original signed change of ownership form which I did on the 4th of Feb 2022. The claims adviser said that they would arrange for fedex to collect the original documents on Monday so i arranged for someone to be at the house to give the documents to the courier fast forward two days of me arranging someone to not leave the house and still no collection. I decided on Wednesday that I would personally drop of the originals and 1 Discovery Place. I delivered the originals personally and they were received and I was told that they now can send me the Agreement of loss for me to sign and send back by close of business on the 9th of Feb. Now today I receive an email from the claims advisor that I now need to go back to the previous owner to ask them to make an affidavit confirming that I bought the vehicle. I understand this and have made the necessary arrangements to get the affidavit.  They are now requesting proof that there are no license fees outstanding on the vehicle even though they have the deregistration certificate which is only issued when the fees are up to date. They are also requesting that I ask the previous owner to once again sign a new change of ownership form yet they have the original in their possession. I call everyday for an update as if I don't call then I am left in the dark. Tomorrow is Friday which is when my claim will be finalised by according to my claims handler yet i have not yet gotten what my vehicles value was let alone the AOL. So how can my claim be finialised. Please HELP I am frustrated by the lack of communication and the fact that claims advisors don't keep their word to clients. Never return calls. Shocking service",1

"My wife had an accident on the 7th of December 2021 and we received feedback the claim has been approved. In January we contacted Discovery to find out when the car will be going in for repairsn as we are still waiting to be contacted to take the car in. We take the car in after the panelbeaters contacted us to take it and after we were informed by discovery they will get the panelbeaters to collect the car. Since then I have spoken to several discovery agents and on several occasions I get cut off and nobody even calls back I have to keep on calling them. Today I speak to another agent and get informed I have two options to finalise the claim one is they pay me out or the other is I have to pay the other costs as it was not part of the accident. So I ask the lady will my vehicle still be covered if they pay me out and I get someone to repair it myself and she says yes. So I give her the go ahead and then she says she is calling the panelbeater to find out if they have ordered the parts before they can pay me out. I cannot understand why my vehicle cannot be repaired properly, but you rather get told some damages are old damages and will not be covered. We should all rather be careful with discovery insure because this is what happens when you claim. You wait two months and still no resolution are positive outcome on the claim. This so frustrating as I get cut off again and the lady does not call me back. I do not know why a person has insurance and pay so much and then still have to struggle in solving the claim and having the vehicle repaired. I am very disgusted in Discovery with the service I have received regarding my claim. I have to struggle everyday to get to work and home, because the car is still with the panelbeaters. I need someone to sort this out, because  it is really not acceptable to still be waiting.",1
"We submitting a building claim 2weeks ago and never received feedback from Discovery Insure. Last night only i received an sms stating that the service provider sent out an invoice for work done and that the claim has been authorised and payment was made to the service provider. 
Just to let you know, no work has been done as yet! No one arranged with us to come out to do the work! Why was payment made if no work was done??
Also, previous claims never took this long and i believe it has something to do with the claim administrator assigned to this - Zodidi Hlati.
Can this please be sorted out asap!",1

I am very unhappy with the type of service received from Discovery Insure. We had a hail storm December 2021 in Pietermaritzburg and I am still waiting for Discovery Insure to respond. The Assessor has been at my house and nothing is happening. I've send the complaints department 2 messages and only received a case number. This was to notify me that someone will call me within 2 working days. This was on 28 Jan 2022 and 7 Feb 2022. Nobody responded! Not even my window has been fixed after I've requested the Assessor to sort it as it is a Safety concern. This window is in my 3 year old daughter's room. He did say to me that it will be sorted the following day and this was 2 weeks ago. This type of service was never expected from Discovery!,1
"It has been a month since I lodged a claim for my items(cellphone, tablet and Apple Watch) that were taken from me. this is probably my third review and the claim has still not been finalised. 

I have been sent from pillar to post. I am promised a phone call everyday but no one calls. I am basically running after discovery every single day. 

All required documentation was submitted. The latest excuse was that they would need to speak to my son who is still in hospital from 1 January 2022. They said they could only finalise the claim after he is out of hospital. This makes no sense because no one knows when he will be out of hospital. I then gave them the address and ward number he is in.No one has attempted to go and speak to him. Needless to state that all I have been told is that I will receive a callback. 

If I am having such an experience on small items like a cellphone, I wonder what a claim for life cover or structural insurance will be like. it is unreasonable for discovery to take a month to finalise such a claim, WHICH HAS STILL NOT BEEN FINALISED. How do they propose I go about life without a cellphone for so long?

I am not sure if I will keep all my other policies with them, and there are quite a few!",1

"No communication for 3 days on a  building claim. After numerous lengthy call centre phone calls still no response and quite frankly unacceptable service from a five star institution whom I pay a large sum of money to every month. Dominic Madlala has not answered any communication whatsoever. How do I proceed further, maybe cancel my insurance and move to another company. Very disappointed indeed.",1

"I have had a claim oustanding since November 2021. We have had numerous assessments on the damage, and to date the claim has not yet been resolved. Discovery Insure has certainly lost its customer focus, with me waiting over 30 minutes on the call and secondly, zero response to my emails. Their service seriously sucks",1
"Good day

I’m writing this email after just being on hold for 10 minutes to get transferred to a agent with no luck.

I have logged a claim nearly two weeks ago , claim number ********** , until today discovery has never called me about the claim instead I had to follow up. Their was water damage that has not added black mould.

I am currently sick from a bacterial infection which is most likely linked to this. Yet discovery is completely absent from helping customers.

I had to phone to get an assessor assigned , then I had to phone to find out a few days later the assessor didn’t accept the job and then only a new assessor was appointed . Am I suppose to be the person running the show.

The incompetence at the claims department is literally making me physically sick because a wet and mouldy kitchen is allowed to just be left like that in my house until you one day decide to do something about it. I did say I could get my own people but I was told no. 

Till today whoever my claim was assigned too hasn’t even bothered to call or email. This is the service you give.",1
"Shamanie Naidoo is an absolute star to work with - A retentions force to be reckon with . Continue to do so regularly - Keep it up, we love it !!",5
"This is my second review about an outstanding claim made on the 17 of November 2021.  I have come to the conclusion that Discovery Insure does not care.  There is no other explanation.  I eventually got hold of my claims consultant, a big joke that I have one.  I thought she left the company after being non-responsive since December.  The lady was neither phased by the fact that this has been outstanding for over three months nor phased by being called out for not replying to my emails. No apology, no acknowledgement of bad customer service.  I have been inconvenienced by my car being stolen.  I am sure that if I was insured with another company I would be driving a new vehicle by now not paying Uber to move around.  I am still paying premiums for a non-existent car until this is resolved.  Discovery Insure does not deserve my business.",1
"First of all i dont know how they won 1# In Customer Experience. So on the 23/01/2022 I was involved in a Car Accident. I am not going into detail about the accident but basics are I was standing at a Red Robot and a Man in his 60s rear ended my car and then he swerved and hit another car on the Police report he admitted his guilt. I was injured in the accident but that evening I managed to speak to a consultant and they then confirmed that the Claim had been logged. 2 days later on 25/01/2022 I Contacted Discovery to find out what is happening as i was told a assessor takes 24-72 hours. The Claims agent informed me that Emergency did not follow procedure and the claim was not logged he apologized on behalf of them and logged the claim and advised me that unfortunatedly the 72 hours will have to restart from the time of claim being logged 2 days later on the 27/01/2022 i called again and this time was greated by a claims agent that informed me that the previous guy had not allocated a Assessor, At this point i am already frustrated because I do not have transport and they have already delayed with a week. He advises me that he will put the assesment through as urgent and i should receive feedback on Friday. Friday the 28/01/2022 i called again this time the Claims agent informed me that there is no way that the assesment will be finalized before the end of the day and i will have to follow up on saterday as they are working. Which I then do on Saterday the 29/01/2022 I call again to find out that the assessors do not work on a Saterday and thus will have to phone on Monday. So again I wait Monday i call and the call centre agent confirms that the Car is a write off or as he put it uneconomical to repair. he advised me that i will receive a call from discovery within the day to understand what the next step is and how we are going about the payout. I waited the Whole monday on Tuesday i decide to phone again the agent advised me that the other guy on monday was supposed to help me. I anycase 2 days later Fedex collected Documents and the spare key it is now a week later and everyday when i call discovery there is some issue as to what they are waiting for. It has been confirmed on multiple calls that i dont need to send anything else. So now I ask you Discovery what is with all the excuses and when will i be receiving the payout. I have all my things with discovery and did not expect this kind of service when a accident happened, I have been accident free since i received my license in 2010. I ask please assist that this matter is resolved. I have also recorded every phone call with discovery and have every call taker/claim agents name for records purposes. This is negligent get this claim sorted so i can move on and forget about this accident. For Reference purposes the claim number is **********",1

"Discovery Insure has become very pathetic and incompetent when dealing with their customers. Very poor customer service in-fact.
Claim Lodged on the 27/01/2022
Received notification on the 27/01/2022 that the claim had been lodged, and who would be dealing with the claim
Received notification that the the vehicle had been booked for assessment.
Assessment was completed.
Received notification on the 02/02/2022 that the claim had been reallocated to another consultant.
Sent an email on the 03/02/2022 requesting information with regards to the claim.
The email was read on the 04/03/2022 and no response. Totally ignored.
Is this Discovery Insure new way of dealing with it's customers.
Every time you are assigned a consultant, they promise you that the consultant will contact you shortly........    Still waiting for the consultant to contact me or respond to the email.

Really poor and pathetic, obviously Discovery has too many customers for them to service effectively!!!!!!!!!!
Good way to loose the people who keep them in bussiness.",1
"Hello Peter. My name is Shirley Ramabodu and am a Client of Discovery.
On the 30th of September we experienced a terrible Natural disaster in my area and most of the houses and businesses were badly affected. My insurance refused to fix my house and even pay out the claim of Home  contents saying the damage was caused by non maintenance of roofing. I tried to write to them so that I can provide them with a proof that I've been maintaining my house but they never responded to my email. To my surprise they always send messages on my phone warning us of hail storm but when we claim they reject our claims.",1

"My name is Philippus Marthinus Coetzee, ID ********** 086.  
CLAIM NO: **********
Discovery Insurance Policy Number:  **********.
My address is 8 Steenbok Street, Hartbeesfontein, North West.
On the 25th of December 2021, at around 14:00 we experienced an unusual thunderstorm.  My 24kVA generator set that provides power to my residence in case of power failure and load shedding was struck by lightning.  I put in a claim for a damaged Deep Sea 4520 Controller and two 63 A SWANFL-11 Contacors as well as for technical services and consumables in the amount of R8206-00.
A lady by the mane of Nombulelo Hegeni told me there is no access fees to be paid, only to find out on the 12th January, after I made various calls to Discovery that there is an endor*****t on my policy and that I have an excess fee of R10 000-00.
When later on the 12th of January I asked the lady Mpho Mukomo about the excess, she told me that Discovery reviewed my policy on the 4th of September 2021 and made this unprecedented decision.  What is very strange, is the fact that this was not communicated to me by e-mail or post or telephonically.
This occurrence strangely took place exactly one year after the introduction of the policy.  If I knew this, I would have cancelled by insurance with immediate effect.  Hence I kept on paying and the total amount exceeds R16 000-00 without me claiming anything during this period.
I believe that they are taking advantage of me and thousands of others and that they are opportunists.

"Jan 28, 2022, 9:52 AM (6 days ago)
to jacquelinen, insurecomplaints, TNKOLONZI, Natasja, pbworks2, Elrika
good morning
I am hoping by drafting this email we can finally get the assistance we've been requesting all month.
Mom being the policy holder and owner of the 2 vehicles insured was hospitalized and in a coma from the 4/12/2021, my little brother stole her car on the 14/12/2021 and had it damaged. We attempted to make a claim however the claim was rejected because he had lied and did not have a driving license
From the 24/12/2012 we received communication of this and told the car was with Auction nation and also given 7 days to go collect the car and the 7th day would have been on the 31/12/2021 we then went to collect the car on the 30th but were unable to get ahold of Nazeer the contact person we contacted discovery and was given a release letter and told to go to Auction Nation our car would be there.
@Auction Nation we found Nazeer who informed us the vehicle was taken to Paramount bodyworks on the 21/12/2021 to have it repaired.
from the following Monday being 3/01/2022 i started calling in to find out what was happening and to this day nobody can give me feedback as to who authorized for the car to be taken to paramount to have it repaired or to even go to paramount
Everyday i called in only to be either put on hold or promised an investigation or call back where 1 day I am told the car is with Auction and this was just confirmed or the car is at Paramount and this was just confirmed
i called in everyday until we took it upon ourselves around the 11-14/01/2022 to go look for the car to know what is happening as discovery clearly did not know what was happening and at Auction Nation they said the same thing car was at Paramount and a gentleman at Paramount told us they had already started repairing the vehicle only to find the engine was irreparable and would advise the insurer and that we needed to contact our insurer to find out a way forward 
i contacted Discovery once again only to be told that the storage bill was about R13000+ and that Discovery would pay that and we can go collect the car
still with no communication from Discovery we called back a couple of days later only to be sent from pillar to post again being promised call backs and feedback up 
to this day nobody can tell us who authorized for the car to be taken to paramount or even repaired and now Paramount wants R26000+ from us to have the vehicle released
we are not willing to pay this amount as i suggest that whoever blundered and did this mistake in the first place should fit the bill
We realize Discovery Insure is playing a duck and dive game with us and we have nobody willing to assist in this matter.
My mom came back from Hospital and after a couple of days we told her what had happened and she called in to find out what she needed to do to claim. She was told to open a case against my brother and submit her doctor notes and documents to reconsider her claim but even when she did that and send those her cries still fell on deaf ears as Kagiso in the claims specialist department has failed to give her any feedback regarding that too.
please can someone help us in this matter with a suitable way forward.
Thank you
Above, is a complaint letter we wrote out to Discovery insure and to this day we have not received any feedback or any communication from the complaints department, managers or teamleaders we have spoken or escalated to.
Kagiso and Natasha are both Teamleaders in the complaints specialist department and to my understanding Jacqueline is their manager but none of these people have bother to cal us, apologise or even communicate any way forward. 
We have exhausted all our complaints channels yet nobody is willing to take responsibility for their blunder and fix this mess, on the other hand paramont keeps telling us about the car being a right off and they require the money for the parts used to fix the car as well as for the storage dating from the 21/12/2021. at this point Discovery should very well fix this vehicle for the mess they have put us through the past month. service level for this has been an absolute pain. I honestly feel they will be the reason my mother relapses into another coma from the stress of been taken for a ride by DISCOVERY INSURE.",1
"One of your clients knock into me last year and after many attempts to contact it has still not been  resolved I will make sure to tell other people not to join you as your service is very very bad, will this issue ever be sorted out",1

I got involved in a car accident on 19th January and the discovery insurances said that they are going to assess the car and give me feedback. so I have been waiting seen's then till today the is no respond and the don't even give me update. the only time I will get the update is when I call them. Am asking myself if is taking them that long to assess the car how long will it take for them to fix my car and when the deduct money they don't even miss the payment. Am so disappointed and very much inconvenienced by their VERY BAD SERVICE am getting coming to think that i trusted them.,1
Prince Sibiya gave me excellent service today,5
"Sandile's Service was good and really quick and straight to the point.
I like that he gave me his email for further assistance.",5
"their client bumped my car, he swerved out of the and came back in again, and when it came back in again it came straight to my car. it hit straight on the side of the tire(out side)the car was no longer drivable. their client sign everything including the liability forms at the police station. now they don't want to pay storage and towing. instead they pay towing and storage for the car of their client only, for my car only approve to fix. we even found out that the storage yard belongs to them. the follow up emails and calls which their client have been doing, its too much. it doesn't worth it

I was about to jump to this insurance but the experience, there's no way",1
"Since the 15th November that my accident happened this is the 2nd hello Peter complaint.

I’ve made countless calls and emails to which I have no response. No manager or escalation team feedback. This is useless service with regards to my car. It’s like no one works at this company. Debit orders are being collected and no service is given. My claim got split into two parts which is engine work and body work, the body work was approved, but the engine was  rejected due to a mechanical assessor providing false information on his report, the assessor provided a totally different story as to what initially happened. I disputed the claim on my engine report and still await feedback.  It’s like discovery looks for every excuse to not pay out.

No resolution till today. I hope this company closes down in the future because dealing with them has left me with no words.",1
There service is pathethic actually i am gona cancel my home insurance spend 6k a month on insurance and dont evem have the decency to tell u  that u claim is rejected that i claomed on it before yet the roof is not the same 1 and i would like to see they prove it,1

Keep it up girl.",5
"Hi Antono

I write to you as with great disappointment. 

Exactly a month ago my husband was hijacked at gun point with his friend.

He logged a claim with Discovery and to date, we haven't received a call from Discovery and the claim is still pending.

As someone who's worked for Discovery Insure when it started I am utterly disappointed with the lack of service.

Discovery prides themselves with services delivery and I was pretty sure that with the high premiums that we are paying, we would never find ourselves complaining about service. A mere claim has never taken a month to finalise, it's simple... It's either you pay or you don't. 

I'd like to think that we have been very patient with you. 

The purpose of Insurance is to give you  piece of mind, my husband was in a very traumatic situation, he almost lost his life. He's still trying to recover from that but Discovery is not making things any easier. 

After this, I'm certain we are taking our business elsewhere.

Hopefully we will feel appreciated and important. 

If the claim is not finalized by tomorrow, can I request the cancelation of the policy and for all premiums to be refunded in full.

I will sharing this on social media too.",1
"Called Discovery to report leak previously reported was not properly fixed.

Discovery Insure sends Service provider inspects after a week and claims its a new leak. Yet its same pipe and rusted.

Now I had explained that it was leaking onto a roof rafter. 

After a week of no feedback I called again.

I called in Saturday 29 January 2022 to follow up. I was told an email would be sent.

I follow up on 31 Jan 2022 and get told they cannot trace the claim.

I call again on 2 February 2022 and get told they'll call the service provider.

Communication has been poor and more shocking us that interactions do not get tracked.

The delay can cause the roof to collapse. I'll be sure to sue Discovery if I get injured during a roof collapse.",1
Boundary wall fell over. During the claim process we were advised that the claim will not be covered as the wall was not built to standard as it had no brickforce. There is no way anyone could have known that the wall was not built to some standard sometime in th 1900s. Really concerned that we are paying for home insurance that doesn't cover claims based on findings that we could not have known or foreseen.,1

Why is it so difficult to get a consultant online to speak to you with out being transferred around to different departments. Why is there never anyone available to file an online complaint to but their is always someone available to offer you discovery insurance.,1

"A car insurance claim for my late mother since November 2021, claim number ********** i have been sending in documents and been transferred to many different departments up until they sent me an agreement of loss and was signed and sent back after numerous calls i was told they wont pay until they get dicuments from courier company which were fetched early January 2022 and i have left many emails to check if they received the documents but there's no response, i then opted for phone calls everytime they always take my number and promise to call me back but nothing.",1
Consultant MATHIBEDI CHUEU was very friendly and helpful.  Excellent manner and disposition.,5
"Had a flat battery, called Msuthu Kwatsha and i was back on the road within 30 minutes",5
"They're are good at the time of accident - help was quick and informative and claim was settled also timeously. Claims department is very efficient: accident was not due to my fault, they managed to get my excess payment from the guilty party. However, something to be aware of - a lot can go wrong during towing, storage and repairs and the insurer sides with the other parties other than the client. If you ever get into the accident - take pictures of absolutely everything - the accident scene and the WHOLE vehicle (interior and exterior), so that you would have a proof if something gets damaged in the process that was not caused by the accident. I was not impressed with the intimidating message from the consultant stating they have resources to prove that damages are not inflicted by the accident therefore client is reaching, but not a single time they have looked into the chain of custody of the car to investigate and use all those resourses to get to the bottom of the problem.",3
Excellent service from Marvin Ngwenya from the Broker Servicing  department,5
Hi I would like to commend  Marvin Ngwenya for a very good service regarding my new business he was professional and sufficient. Thank you,5

"Please Please whatever you do DO NOT take out insurance from this company. I have been a member for many years and I am trying to make changes to my motor vehicle policy. its a shambles. you can send multiple emails which they acknowledge, but nothing gets done. I am still waiting for a refund for a vehicle  I requested removal in July 2021, I am still waiting for the refund because they continued to bill me up to Dec 2021. I have also requested they remove another vehicle and I am still waiting for this vehicle to be removed. I think its time to just cancel and move on to someone else. totally fed up at this point",1
"I just recieved a call from one on discovery insure lead warmer, I must say what a terrible experience it was as this lady was rushing to do a the quote for me and as soon as I asked her to kindly call me later she put the phone down in my ear. What a very rude behavior",1

Thank you Mathibedi ! Your assistance is highly appreciated!",5
"I reported my accident on the 6th of Jan. I had to ask for car hire on the 7th of Jan. I had to call them on the 21st of Jan to ask about how much the longer assessor needs because I need some kind of information. Only to find out that they had received the report and didn't communicate. Then they said they needed documents. Fedex collect documents almost a week ago and now discovery says that the documents haven't been logged in yet. its been almost 7 days since they received the documents. The car hire ends this weekend. How am i supposed to go to work without a car? On top of that I can't buy a new car because I don't know when they will pay me out. I will have to add days to the car hire, which is extra unnecessary expense. The cherry on top of this is that discovery took their premiums for my totaled car.They have communicated poorly and can not see how their tardy actions are affecting me financially. i really do not want to insure with them again.",1
"I had a pipe burst which flooded the main bedroom on the 24th of Jan 2022 , i have had no interaction from Discovery from then till the 29th when i called them and i was promised a manager plus consultant will call me back ( Did not happen on the 29th ) 
on the 31st in the afternoon i had to call again to follow again i had to make contact with then from my end , taking into account i have had contents being impacted by water and yet no call to even introduce themselves to me , no direction at all and it feels like they don't care.
After me making contact a week later i get a call only to be told they are busy no consideration of my claim situation at all ( Claim Number ********** ).I still wonder if i had not called i would have not received any services at all.",1
Logged a claim for one of my vehicles insured with Discovery. No response for 2 days and then I'm told to go to a service Centre. The contact number given for the service provider does not exist. Tried to call discovery 3 times to check what the assessment process is and have to wait at least half an hour each time after which the call cuts. Really bad service. Going back to Outsurance who are way way better.,1
"I cancelled my policy in December after struggling numerous times to actually receive my policy that I got told to move from my current insurer. I was eventually contacted by Xolani Shangase who sent me the policy, I made it clear to him that I am not interested but will look at the policy. Please go listen to the phone recordings. He told me he will move the starting date to end of Jan but I still wasn’t interested but said I will have a look. I sent him an e-mail on 4 Jan 22 stating that I still was not interested in the policy. Got no further response from him and this policy was never cancelled as per numerous requests. Yet a debit order goes off! Now how am I supposed to pay Outsurance my chosen insurance as Discovery feels they may make my choice for me. Absolutely ridiculous. I will reverse this debit order and I would like Discovey to cancel this policy with immediate effect as I told you I DO NOT WANT YOUR POLICY. If this is how one needs to struggle to get a policy and get it cancelled I can’t even begin to imagine the hassle of putting in a claim and getting it approved.",1
"The worst household items insurance service I have ever experienced.
They will trick you by offering good prices and when time comes to pay, they will have so many tricks up their sleeve to reject your claim.",1

"Discovery has poorly managed my insurance claim. I lodged a claim for a laptop on the 7th of January, and this is still not resolved. 

Discovery did not even arrange the courier correctly to collect so i had to go get an assessment done at my own cost. Al documentation and a SIGNED Payout letter has been received by Discovery yet they have still not paid out my claim.",1

"Claim no: 28092
My son (Regular Driver of the vehicle) was involved in an motor vehicle accident where a person bumped into the back of my vehicle on the 10.01.2022. We reported the accident at the SAPS Secunda and I submitted a claim at Discovery.
My claim ********** was registered and I received a SMS confirmation on the 11.01.2022. I was also requested per SMS to take my vehicle for an assessment to Modern Autobody on 13.01.2022 at 08:00 which I did. I received an email from Moipone Kgokolo on the 13.01.2022 updating me that in order for her to proceed with the claim she was awaiting the assessment report. She also stated that after receipt of the assessment report (turnaround time for report within 3days) she would provide me with detailed feedback. After not hearing anything from Discovery I decided to phone Moipone Kgokolo on Tuesday 18.01.2022. Moipone Kgokolo informed me then that she received the report and was busy opening it and I requested her to call me back with feedback. She never came back to me. I send her an email on the 19.01.2022 and requested her to contact me with detailed feedback regarding my claim. No reply. Then I received a SMS on the 20.01.2022 that my claim has been re-allocated to Jabulile Mathobela. I tried numerous times to contact Jabulile Mathobela to try and find out what is happening to my claim and my options. No success talking to her. On Friday 21.01.2022 at 13:14 I spoke to Sanele Ngidi who told me that I could get my own quotations and get my car repaired privately. According to him I would have to send the quotations to Discovery. My vehicle is insured for retail value R29200.00 at Discovery. According to him the repair cost to my vehicle was just over R18000-00. That is less than 70% of the vehicle retail value. According to me a vehicle is written off when there is more than 70% damages.  He informed me that Discovery would deduct the R4000-00 access and that the quotations for repair should not be more than R14000-00. I then went out for quotations as suggested by him and send it through per my private  email to Jabulile Mathobela the same day. On Monday 24.01.2022 I received an email from Jabulile Mathobela stating that they need the Natis document to valid claim for a full payment, and should I be interested in buying back the vehicle I must buy back the vehicle from Auction Nation and repair it on a private account. I called Discovery again on 25.01.2022 and spoke to Yolande Maritz where I pleaded my case that I could not afford for my vehicle to be written off and me buying it back from Auction Nation. She then also suggested that I send my own quotations to Discovery. I then after talking to Yolande resend the quotation per email to Yolande, Jabulile Mathobela and Manasseh and told them that I cannot afford for the vehicle to be written off and requested them to inform me about my options.
Up to today 30.01.2022 I did not receive any phone call, email or SMS with detailed feedback regarding my claim.
I am really disappointed in the way Discovery is handling my claim and the treatment I received as a customer in my time of need
The person who bumped into my vehicle was already paid out and his vehicle is being repaired. His insurance went the extra mile to assist him.
All I want is for somebody from Discovery to call me and give me detailed feedback regarding my claim with all of my options.
I really don’t believe the only option that Discovery can give me is to write my vehicle off and then I must negotiate with Auction Nation to buy my vehicle back.
There must be some other options?
Thank you

Thank you for the great service Zunaid Joseph . You understood what I was asking and made sure the service provided was great,5

Excellent service,5
Dealing with MATHIBEDI CHUEU and the service is exceptional. Thumbs up!!,5
Thanking Natasha Johnson for her amazing service and for her patience as well.,5
I called in to cancel my home and car insurance policy and had a few questions as to what would be the best way to go about doing it. Daniel Gonsalves was super helpful and knowledgable about how to handle my query and got it done very quickly (and didn't try to cross-sell anything to me and respected my request). Thanks so much for making my admin much easier!,5
Received great service from Nomfundo Sibeko,5
Great service from Thibi Chueu who helped me resolve an issue with my monthly premium. Successful customer retention thanks to top class client experience.,5
I had quite an urgent query I needed help with yesterday and I was feeling extra frustrated so I wasn't the best person to deal with However Jabu Zwane at Discovery Insure Broker Servicing assisted me very patiently her service was absolutely impeccable.,5
"On 20 January 2022 I posted a review with regards to queries I have had since August 2021 with Discovery and their DQ Mapper System. I was phoned that afternoon, promising me that a specialist team would investigate the matter and that I would be phoned again within 48 hours. None of this has happened. Incorrect points are still being deducted for so called bad driving (which it is not) and therefore I am losing weekly rewards on an ongoing basis. Why have a rewards driven program if you do not reward your clients due to errors on your side? Is this then not false advertising? Should this matter be reported to a regulatory company?",1
Nomfundo Sibeko - Super friendly and I really enjoyed her service.  She is was extremely helpful providing all the information and answering all my questions..,5
Friendly and competent service,5
"Thank you! Natasha Johnston for always giving me excellent service, my thanks is way overdo, you always ready to help with all my queries and a pleasure to talk to. Thank you for your patience :)",5
I needed to make changes in my existing policy. Nomfundo Sibeko was a real star in sorting me out. The whole process was smooth and she was very professional.,5
Michaela McPherson is an absolute angel! She went above & beyond to help me more than was required of her. A true star!,5
"I submit a claim to discovery for a building. Due to all the rain we had, i had water coming into my house. The water caused the tiles to come loose. We stay in the house for 8 years and the house is more than 15 years old. Discovery declined the claim and said because of the pebbles next to the house the water couldn't drain and the tiles come loose because of poor workmenship... Since we stayed in the house this never happened previously and Discovery except us as clients without any exceptions. So how fair is the discussion  they made...",1
"Had two premium increases in a space of a 12 month period.

In November 2021 my car insurance premium was increased by Discovery and this was well communicated, on 26 January 2022 Discovery insure decided to increase my insurance premium by 15.7%

Upon my query of the sudden increase, the insurer told me that they decided to increase premiums due to high volumes of claims they received from their clients in the past year as well as adverse weather conditions. 

I found the above explanation was far fetched and did not make commercial sense because I have not claimed from Discovery for over 2 years and surely Discovery Insure should have a business model to forecast claim risk factors upon their yearly increase. 

It is totally worrying to be with an insurer who can decide whenever that they will increase premiums, more than once in a year even. 

I then asked that the insurer give me a lower quote of which they refused and said the increased insurance premium is the lowest premium they could give me.",1
"Can someone at Discovery Insure call me about a claim that's basically been ignored since day one.

I've complained on HelloPeter and have been promised by at least 6 different people that the claim will be attended to, this after I had to phone Discovery Insure. 

The lack of communication and service is beyond me.",1
"I just want to thank Discovery for their quick respond and authorization of my 1st claim with them.  I moved from a previous insurer to Discovery only 2 months ago and the quick and professional and friendly service from Abigail really impressed me.
Thank you Discovery and Abigail",5
"One star is too many...
I have been trying to lodge a claim since 18 January. The Discovery APP does not work, I emailed them, was told someone will contact me. It is now 9 days later and no one has been in touch. Call them now, or tried twice twice and get cut off.
Professional service? Laughable.
Why do you make it so difficult to get in touch? None of your options work. You are trying to be too far advanced with technology and have no backup if this does not work. If anyone is interested, please call me, otherwise, cancel my policy.",1
"I was involved in accident on Friday 21/01/22. I was issued a claim number by Yolande M that afternoon. She emailed on Monday that she is awaiting an assessors report. Tuesday I emailed her saying the other person involved wants to know what's the process and Discovery insure needs to contact him. No reply to the email. Wednesday morning I emailed her asking for an update, no reply. Wednesday afternoon I called Discovery Insure, I was informed by a friendly and helpful Boitshepo Baitsile that the car was written off and I need to fill in change of ownership but docs need to be sent to Yolande M. I emailed her again yesterday afternoon asking what is Discovery going to pay out, once again no reply. I emailed her this morning asking her to at least acknowledge receipt of my emails. No response whatsoever. I called Discovery again, another helpful consultant said she will tell Yolande to reply, still no replies. Had I not being calling in to find out what's going on I would still be waiting for the assessors report.",1
Good Service by Mathibedi,5
Impeccable services from Natasha Johnston from the Broker Servicing  department. She is very friendly and is always so excited to help and gets things done very efficiently.,5
"I was involved in a car accident on the 28th November 2021. My car was towed same day to the panel beaters Dent Tech in Rustenburg. The insurance gave approval to them on the 7th Decent 2021. Since then, I've been told that the panel beaters are waiting for the parts from Mercedes Benz. I complained to the insurance that they should move my car to another panel beaters in Johannesburg as I am based there. They're refusing to my request, whilst I don't have a car to drive. I am paying for a car that I don't have and the courtesy car was only for 31 days.
For further information I am available on **********, email address is ***********.",1
"Sooo... the purpose of an insurer is to assist you when you need them most. Right?

On some clients they make a huge profit, on others they sometimes make a loss due to unforeseen evens. Yet, they only action the latter in terms of exorbitant premium adjustments and compulsory excesses.

Discovery Insure is only interested in profit. Despite being claims free for a year now, they refuse to remove extremely large compulsory excesses which have been placed on ALL my insured items, due to two water damage claims, which was no fault of my own.

If you can help it at all, please look for your insurance elsewhere.",1
Its almost a month and discovery is still battling to resolve the issue of the system and policy document discrepancy on my policy number:**********. What the policy document says and what discovery have been debiting my account for almost a year are two different figure and i get told by the call center that there is a system error. Here is a thing: Discovery is way too big to have this kind of error and the sad part i just can't get any communication nor feedback from Sandile. Can i please get my refund and you get your house in order. Checked my policy document today and i hope this month you debit what is on my policy document and my anniversary you also debit what is on my policy document. Overall i am pretty satisfied with Discovery Insure until this issue which doesn't seem like anyone want to resolve it.,1
Excellent service from Thibi Chueu. Received a good rate for both my vehicles. Thank you,5
Excellent service from Mathibedi Chueu...He was willing to go an extra mile with helping me reduce my premiums by applying discounts.He was also friendly,5
"Got a Phone call from a Discovery Insure consultant this morning,
all was fine until he as who my current motor insurance was with and laughs and said they not a real insurance,  and  then  continues to ask for my information, so that he can quote me on a insurance policy, as the call continues he keeps on belittling the company I'm insurance with, I was not happy with this at all and ask him directing why he is doing so, and he told me he not he is comparing the benefits of my needs, no where was the talk about what type of cover I was looking for or the benefits of my current insurance was mention. I also asked as where he got my contact information the call came to a quick stop and was ended",1
"I had the most wonderful experience phoning the call centre of Discovery Insure. Consultant, Mathibedi Chueu assisted me and he was really helpful and professional! Thank you for making my experience worthwhile Thibi! I will recommend Discovery Insure wherever I go.",5
"A client of Discovery knocked into me on the 15th December 2021. On the 10th of January 2022 I was told to take my car for an assessnent.

Last week i called them for feedback and I was told they recieved the assessment and will finalize everything this week, they'll get back to. 

I decided to call the call centre at 16:30-16:35  26 January 2022 and the lady that helped me said that the client isn't liable for payment because the accident wasn't her fault as she was smashed and grabbed. I became irritated and asked how could it not have been their client's fault because I was standing in front of her at a red robot so it couldn't have been my fault. She argued with me because she (the call centre agent) implied that the accident is the person who broke into the ladies car's fault and therefore the matter must be escalated to the legal department. While we were talking she tried to talk over me and instead of trying to understand what i was saying and resolving the matter, she put the phone down without resolving anything. 

Why did you send me for an assessment if i wasn't going to be assisted? 

Its as if you are doing everything in your power not to pay clients, but you recieve their money onbtime every month.",1
Beyond disappointed and frustrated!!! Pathetic communication and almost zero feedback and updates on progress of the claim. Incompetent assessors with little to no experience or knowledge on the equipment they had to assess. Claimed against my power surge cover on a Fridge and Freezer and three months later the claim is still not finalised!! Really bad customer service from such a big company that promotes and prides itself on customer service and quality!!,1
I am a Discovery employee (working for broker office) and constantly need to phone Discovery Insure in order to do follow ups or initiate requests. Working with MATHIBEDI CHUEU from the Retentions department was great! A real Gem to work with. Thank you for your kind demeanor towards me and your efficient assistance.,5
"Please can I have feedback on my query, which is currently with your System's division for investigation. 

Note emails sent previously: 
11 November 2021, 07h37: Reference **********. I asked about my reward status. 
11 November 2021, 15h32: Reference ********** & **********. I notified you that the wrong correspondence was sent to me belonging to a different member of your scheme. 
12 November 2021, 12h28: Reference ********** & **********. I gave you my correct details and asked again about the status of my reward. 
13 November 2021, 12h01: I receive correspondence that says: The premium payback gets paid when your Plan gets to 6 months, the sixth month will be
December. 
13 December 2021, 11h59: I enquired again that all was in order for my reward to be paid. 
14 December 2021, 09h42: I receive the wrong correspondence again with details of a different member of your scheme. 
15 December 2021, 07h53: I follow up again since my query was not answered about when I can expect my reward. 
16 December 2021, 16h59: I was sent a copy of the terms and conditions regarding the payback, no answer to my very specific question regarding my anticipated payout. 
14 January 2022, 19h50: I asked again about my specific situation regarding the reward and said I would appreciate a response as soon as possible. Was given reference **********. 
17 January 2022, 09h28: I received a response from you as follows: Thank you for contacting us. Please see the below terms and conditions for the 50% cash back benefit.
• When you take up a new policy, you will have 3 months from Date of commencement to achieve the Gold status. Once you have achieved the Gold status this automatic make you qualify for the 50% cash back.
• Payouts will be made on month 7 from when they achieve Gold status
17 January 2022, 10h03: I responded as follows: Okay thank you for the correspondence. Does this mean I will get the payout in March 2022 since Gold status was reached in September 2021? Received reference ********** & **********. 
17 January 2022, 22h08: I received the following feedback from you: Thank you for contacting us. Kindly be advised that you do not qualify as you didn't achieve the goal status within the first 3 months of inception. 
18 January 2022, 05h18: I responded as follows: I disagree. My bank account was debited 30 June 2021 meaning my cover started 30 June 2021. I achieved Gold status in September 2021. That is within 3 months. That's silver in July 2021, silver in August 2021 and Gold in September 2021. Please escalate this query to a manager as this is totally unfair and Discovery is now trying to cheat me out of thousands of rands. 
18 January 2022, 05h55: I responded further as follows: You can not count June as a qualifying month because that would have meant I needed to achieve gold status in one day. And even if I did not meet your ""conditions"" this was not communicated to me when I took out the plan, you can listen to the recording I had to do my own research with little to no information available on your website to find out I needed to gain gold status, nowhere was I told about this, or the other requirements. This is why Gold status was achieved only in September. I was only sent the list of requirements when I asked about the payback in November. Also my understanding was I get the payback after 6 months, so to me that was January 2022. Then to be told its the 7th month after getting gold status, which meant March/April 2022 and then to be told no sorry you do not qualify. And I had to ask and ask and ask over and over before I was told this, check the emails. This is totally unfair. 
18 January 2022, 17h38: You responded as follows: Thank you for contacting us.
We have referred the matter to the Systems department for assistance. Please allow 3 to 5 working days for feedback to be provided. Your reference number is QC344530
26 January 2022, 07h42: I requested feedback on this issue again. 

So here I am on HelloPeter trying to get this resolved. It feels like I sent a million emails re this issue, and another week has passed and I still have not received any feedback on this. I need closure on this issue asap, please. Not the run around that you have given me since November 2021. Please. Thank you.",3
"What a pathetic service .. a company which doesn’t take ownership at all .. I made claim , they said I must send pictures of the damages so I sent them all . They assessed and approved my claim only to find out they did not include everything now I’m stuck with their partner workshop to fix my car , I have spoken with Legogang after 21 minutes on the phone she said there is no available manager and now I have been on the phone with  Nkadi while holding for 10min to speak with a manager she decided to drop the call .. never 👎🏽 insure here if they make  mistakes on your policy they will not even override their mistake they will say they can’t do anything about it ..",1
"Afternoon  Cleopatra,

I am applaud at the quality of service from discovery more particularly the specialist claims team. I am beyond dissatisfied and utterly disappointed at how my claim has been handled from the very beginning. 

On the 29th of December 2021, my car was collected and placed on a flat bed after an accident. It was one disaster after another from there on. The first issue 

1. I was without a courtesy vehicle for several days also due to an issue from Discovery’s end which left me utterly inconvenienced, you can check the notes and follow up with the relevant teams on your end to find out the exact details.

2. When the car was collected (placed on the flatbed) I filled in a one page document which indicated the particulars of the car and the damage, this document also stipulated where the car would be taken. All this documentation to be referred back to Discovery and then forwarded to the Assessors (NetAssess). Which to my knowledge was not. Which later revealed that neither Discovery nor NetAssess had any knowledge of where my car had been taken, which up until this morning none of the specialist claims assistants knew exactly where my vehicle was. 

3. On the 3rd of January at apx 15:00 I received a call from Discovery drive in centre in Sandton regarding me bringing my vehicle in for assessment? How would this even be possible if the car had been placed on a flatbed and taken to a Mysterious Yard that even Discovery can not tell me which yard the car was taken to?? On the 10th of January I was then called again and asked the same nonsensical question, I told the lady that she should know exactly where my vehicle was as this should have been in the notes made with details provided by Discovery, which it was not. At this point in time we have a lost/stolen vehicle because Discovery can not account on the location of the vehicle! 

4. Monday 24th January I call in to find out what is happening with my claim, there is no sense of urgency to try resolve this instead I am lied to by a claims specialist that she will escalate my concerns which never happened, I indicated to her that my car hire will end on the 5 of February yet I still do not have any feedback from Discovery but they have inconvenienced me immensely!! 

I need answers and I do need them immediately because I can’t be paying for a car that is not in my possession and worse of all is no one can give me an exact location of where my car is and what will happen once my car hire duration has ended, is Discovery expecting me to walk in my pregnant state and put my children on my back to get them to school?? Should I go to the police station and report the car missing/stolen because Discovery can not give me the exact location of where my car is?? You need to explain because even when I emailed Sindi last week I did not even receive a response/acknowledgment! So I need answers and I need them immediately. 

My next step in recourse would be to report the car as missing to the police and Discovery will be held liable for that because as the Insurer who authorised that the vehicle be collected and transported you should know the exact location of my car which you do not!!

I need answers Cleopatra and I need them now!!",1
"I serviced my car at a Bosch service center and as part of discovery insure we receive a discount based on our vitality drive status (which I take seriously). The system was down/ off line whatever the story was, so they contacted discovery who said just forward the payment to discovery afterwards and we will refund the discount to the member. This was done November 2, we are coming up on 3 months ago, and 3 emails by myself to follow up on this. Can I have any kind of feedback here? I get the automated response, but are the relevant people still on holiday, what is happening here?",1
Great service  Prince Sibiya,5
Thank you for the assistance Sandile Mhlanga. Professionally well-done.,5
"Thank you Natasha Johnston! 

My experience was pleasant, thanks to how patient and considerate you were in dealing with my query. 

SA would be in a better place if we had more people like you :)",5
"I have been for two months now since December trying to communicate with claims agent Collen Baloyi who has ignored all of my emails. Despite me finally getting ahold of him on the phone last week. By luck when I called the call centre he picked up the phone and when I asked him why he did not respond to my emails, he said he couldn't find them. I asked him to email so I could forward my messages again and when he mailed me I directly responded to the exact email address which have been ignored now for two weeks. The reason I have been so desperately trying to get hold of Collen is that when I lodged my claim (Claim No **********) for hail damage, my car was taken to Renew-IT in Sandton. They have their own policy of repairing cars with 10 days but repairs to my car took a month. I contacted Renew-IT when my 10 day car hire with AVIS was ending to find out what was taking so long, they said I must contact DISCOVERY to extend my car rental period with AVIS so they complete repairs. I made multiple calls to discovery and could not get an agent, then I emailed Collen who had initially emailed me with my claim number. Collen ignored my emails and after three days had lapsed for car hire, I called again and a new agent managed to make arrange the extension. Renew- IT took 28 days to fix my car and I called AVIS to come and collect theirs. They delayed for two days despite us setting a time for collection. Eventually they arrived to collect the car. I received an sms from AVIS requesting R3 000 for scratches to the rental car, which I had reported immediately on collection. I was happy to pay this and made several calls to their Direct Billing office to pay for damages. I then got a letter of Demand on Monday for R5 000 for repairs. The additional costs were for extended car hire - This extended period is either the 3 days in which Collen Baloyi ignored my emails and did not arrange an extension, or the two day period where AVIS delayed to collect their car. I forwarded the letter of demand to Collen asking him to sort out this billing matter, I received an email from him requesting my claim number (which he has) but, sent it again.  In the email where I sent him my claim number, I highlighted that it was unacceptable that he has been ignoring my emails since December and that the matter needs to be sorted out as soon as possible because AVIS requires payment within 7 days.  It is no surprise that Collen has ignored this email too. I am at my wits end trying to communicate with Collen to sort out my bill, which I have made an active effort to pay by making numerous calls to AVIS direct billing, but when I was billed an extra R2 000 and requested assistance from my claim manager Collen Baloyi there has been continuous ignoring of my emails. This has been the most disappointing experience I have had with discovery, having been a client 5 years. And not just the issue of paying AVIS for extended days but also trying to deal with Renew-IT for damages they made to my car while it was being serviced. This information was also emailed to Collen and also been ignored.",1
I had received fantastic service from Shamanie Naidoo whereby she assisted me with retention on one of my clients. She was most professional and delightful in dealings and appreciate her great service.,4
Amazing service from Mathibedi Chueu. Thank you so much for your service. Continue being a star!,5
"We had support from Joelene Scholtz recently and she was fabulous, helpful, responsive, the service requested was carried out efficiently.  We continue to be pleased with Discovery Insure's service",5
Terrible service from Discovery Insure. I’ve been requesting call backs from them for days on end but nobody seems to be bothered. I’ve even expressed my dissatisfaction with their service and even told them I’m considering canceling my policy with them. This is ridiculous honestly,1
"It is, unfortunately, the second time I had to interact with Discovery Insure since I joined from my previous insurer. And must admit, the second time I regret moving from my previous insurer to Discovery Insure. 

The service, in my opinion, is way below the standard that I am used to from my previous insurer. 

I woke up on Saturday 15 January 2022 with my TV not working, the screen was pink. We had a thunderstorm the previous night and I assumed it was because of that.

I logged a claim on the app, received a mail that my claim will be handled by Ashleigh Abrahams, and that she will contact me – BUT NOTHING happened since!!

It is now 1 ½ weeks since I logged a claim – no communication from Discovery Insure, no contact – nothing!

I went ahead and bought myself a new TV in the meantime since I cannot wait for sub-stander service to come to light.",1
I have been in an accident on 27 Dec 2020. Discovery's feedback on my two claims is non-exictant. I have today spent at least 45 min on the phone without succeeding to speak to a discovery claims consultant. The claims consultant allocated to me has since 4 Jan 2022 not responded to any email from both my broker and myself.,1
My car was involved in an accident on 02/12/21. It was then taken to Renew it Rivonia Panelbeaters and a claim was registered. My frustration is that I have been sending emails to request intervention and assistance to contact the panelbeaters in order to speed up the process. I had to return back the rental car since I was informed that my plan was only for 30 days. The only support I am receiving from the insurance is non existent. They are sending emails to the panelbeaters and forwarding their responses to me. I made several attempts to call Michelle who is handling my claim on Friday 21/01/22 and was informed by the guy named Wandile that if by 12pm I haven't received any feedback he will call me back. To date I haven't received any call from my insurance except emails which do not serve any purpose according to me.,1
My experience with broker servicing has been consistently great. This time around great appreciation to Marvin Ngwena for impeccable service and always ensuring queries are resolved.,5
"If you ever get hit by a discovery insure client, never listen to the ""oh don't worry my insurance will handle everything"" line because you will be left unsure, spend endless time on the phone, you will be the one calling to find out how far along in the process you are and after 2months of driving around with a damaged car. You will get sent to a 2 star panel beater who will quote 10k less than any real approved Autobody and you will be left paying the difference to get a decent repair job done after wasting all your time. 
Claim instead from your insurance, allow them to fight for your excess make sure you have excess cover and ensure your 400k+ vehicle is treated how it should be. 
Worst experience ever.",1
I recently dealt with Shafick Allow in Retentions at Sandton Branch. He was very helpful and sorted out my query quickly,5
"There was a mix up with payment on my account for almost two months, everybody that I spoke to, to resolve the issue kept on confusing me even more and not helping at all. then there came a gentlemen by the name of Shafiq Alloow, a man with few words but efficient and effective. He resolved my issue in less than 5 minutes discussion.",5
Excellent and professional service from Mathibedi Chueu! Thanks so much for the efficient assistance.,5
Excellent service thank you MATHIBEDI CHUEU,5
"our vehicle had gotten stolen, I contacted disc insure and they assisted very promptly. 
I had shortfall cover which they said covers a maximum of R150000, they attained a settlement letter which summed up to R262000 (in that R262k I am aware I had extras for R32000). The vehicle retail value is R171500 after seeing the claim payout amount i see that they paid R179500 - They deducted the excess of R10500. I know the extras are not covered. HOW CAN THE TOTAL PAYOUT BE R179500 IF THE VEHICLE WAS VALUED R171500 and I have had it for 6 months ???? YOU ARE TELLING ME THE SHORTFALL ONLY PAID R18000???? this is causing me stress I am unable to perform at work due to this you guys are costing my job which requires me to have a 100% mindset !!! contact me and fix this ASAP!!!",1

"I am disgusted with the lack of service delivery I am getting from Discovery insure. On the 16th of December we had an accident whilst on holiday in Cape Town and because all the repair centres we already closed, we knew the vehicle would only be attended to in January. I then called the very next day to the special claims department to ask what would happen with our vehicle as we were due back in JHB on the 3rd of January for school and work, and I was informed that the vehicle would be towed back to JHB. On the 2nd occasion, when I called the same department, to arrange a courtesy vehicle for JHB as we would be returning the 1st one at the airport, I asked again for the 2nd time for confirmation on what would happen with our vehicle and was informed, once again that the vehicle would be towed back to JHB. These calls are recorded by the way. Today, 25/01/22, when I received feedback from the panel beaters that my vehicle was ready for collection, I called into discovery to now hold them to their promise, only to be told that this was not correct and they can only arrange airfare and I must drive my own vehicle back. I then asked to speak to someone in authority as I was told TWICE that this was the promise from their side. I was put on hold for over 30 minutes and no one came back to me until the call eventually cut, I then called the claims department back, only to be put on hold for a 2nd time and then told after a few minutes that there was no manager available to take my call, they are all in meetings. An organization as large as discovery has NO MANAGER, ANYWHERE IN THE WHOLE BUILDING to take my call, yeah right!! I then insisted they pull one out of a meeting and tell them that this matter is urgent, only for the snooty agent to tell me that she will NOT BE DOING THAT, I then said, you need to get someone to assist me now as I refuse to be lied to and be expected to take it lying down, I am now back on hold, with no end in sight, it's been a further 21 minutes and counting. This by the way is NOT THE FIRST INCIDENT OF FALSE PROMISES MADE BY THE CLAIMS DEPARTMENT, last year my broker had to intervene as there was also false information given to me. I am cancelling ALL MY POLICIES WITH DISCOVERY BECAUSE ALL THEY DO IS LIE, AND BEST BELIEVE ME I AM TAKING THIS TO THE OMBUDSMAN, THEY NEED TO BE BROUGHT TO JUSTICE FOR MISLEADING A CLIENT.",1
Thank you Natasha Jonhson from Broker Servicing for always assisting me with the administration of our Discovery Insure clients. Well Done!!!!!!,5
"Paid for the warranty policy for a while, once I had to use benefits, I found them irresponsible manipulating with false promises in the brochure. 
Terrible customer management. At the end I have to replace my warranty plan with a more reliable one.",1
brilliant service from Shamanie Naidoo!!!! thank you for making my day,5
There's one thing I love about the discovery insurer broker servicing team you get different characters with different attitudes whenever I called I will get an excellent service from them especially Prince Sibiya he will make you feel more welcome can someone please give him Bells he deserves it.,5

"I have had to do all admin regarding my household insurance claim on behalf of Discovery Insure. I might as well move my service. The claims consultant assigned has not made contact, their number doesn't exist either. I have not received a single call regarding my claim, I've had to follow up three times, my calls are being dropped today. Where can I escalate this to and get some service?",1
"I decided to go with Discovery insure for my contents and car insurance. Discovery requested that I do a pre inspection on our 2 cars within the Discovery app and forward on to them. Doesn't matter how many times I tried it would not work. Then I went to Tiger Wheel and Tire for them to do the inspection and they said they no longer do it. I spent a good part of the day completely frustrated with this matter on hand. I spoke to an advisor at Discovery and they asked me to forward the pictures and they would deal with it from there end. I then got a message telling me they cannot do it this way. By this time I'm pulling my hair out. I called again and was assured by an advisor that sending him pictures directly he would sort out the matter. I have heard nothing since. This has been going on for a month!!!. On Thursday I went on to the Discovery FB page and complained. Someone sent me a message on messenger and assured me it would be sorted. Needless to say still nothing and it's now Tuesday 25th. I honestly can't comprehend how bad this service can be. Discovery were quick enough to sign me up and take my money but the service in relation to speed of taking my money is despicable. 

Discovery you should be ashamed of your lack of service delivery.",1
Thank you Mathibedi Chueu for always assisting our clients to the best of your availability. Keep it up Buddy.,5
"I lodged a claim for being held at gunpoint where my cellphone, tablet and watch were taken. I was from the hospital to visit my son in ICU. 

I lodged the claim on the discovery app. I was contacted days later by a representative who asked me for the same documents which were already uploaded on the app. 

I obliged immediately but days passed and was asked for more information. I sent follow up emails and the remained unanswered. When I did get an answer, I was asked for more information. the representative told me that she does not always have access to her emails that's why she doesn't answer some emails. 

I have even been asked for proof of service of my vehicle, which has nothing to do with the claim. 

This is the last email sent, and it too has not been answered:


Good day, 

First, we did not receive the email which you apparently sent. I’m not sure why there isn’t a date and time stamp showing that it was actually sent?

Second, what is the turn around time for a finalisation of a claim of this nature?

Third, I have gathered the information you have requested (to the best of my ability). I contacted mtn to provide itemised billing for the month of January but they stated that it will only be available on 2 feb 2022 for the iPhone. I have provided screenshots which should satisfy your requirements.

Fourth, it would seems as though the information is being requested in a piecemeal fashion in order to rely on “we needed further information before we could complete the claim"" this is totally unacceptable.  Even the information requested has no bearing of the claim or it is information which was already uploaded or police reports which discovery should be aware that it is never given to the complainant. Another instance is the request for service invoice. That cannot have any bearing on the claim. 

Fifth, we are going through a lot as a family and for discovery to be conducting itself in this fashion really leaves much to be desired. We therefore demand that an outcome be provided by the close of business today, otherwise this needs to be escalated.",1
I had an emergency situation with my geyser tripping the main switch. Jabulile Shiba from Discovery assisted me in no the geyser was working and we had hot water. Me and my family are happy. Thanks to Jabu and Discovery Insure.,5
"For the first time, i am extremely disappointed with Discovery Insure.

Almost 3 weeks ago, Discovery approved a windscreen replacement claim on my car. Today Discovery closed the claim stating the windscreen had been replaced even though my windscreen had not been replaced. 

A lady named Ofentse was assigned to handle my claim has also changed my perception of Discovery. In the past, those that are assigned to handle claims made all efforts to ensure speedy repairs. She has adopted an approach that sees no end in sight.",1

"This would be the first time I have claimed on my household insurance. Although I have paid loyally for many years it would seem trying to claim is not possible. having to deal with absolutely incompetent and uncaring staff, and not being able to speak to a manager even though I have asked to on numerous occasions for an entire month... To replace one computer. DISGUSTING AND YOU ARE SCAMMERS, YOU STEAL PEOPLES MONEY.",1
"On the 31 December 2021, our car key was stolen with a bag, which we reported. After speaking with Discovery Insure on the phone, they sent a tow truck. The tow truck driver tampered with the gear shift box in order to move the automatic vehicle.

The car was taken to Audi Centre in Cape Town. They quoted for the key, as well as for the gear shift, stating that they could not guarantee it is in working order once it leaves their possession as it has been tampered with. After numerous dropped calls from Discovery's remote consultants and an unanswered email to the claim's team manager, we involved our broker.

On the 12 January 2022, we received via email the claim authorisation for the key. This was great news, as there had been no communication as to what was happening moving forward. Audi explained to us the gear shift could only be assessed once the key is made, so that the vehicle could be started. Bearing in mind, that payment from Discovery takes 3 days and from ordering the key once payment is made to Audi, the key is ready in 5 days.

Now we just waited to hear regarding the gear shift. Last week Thursday evening, 20 January 2022, we received a claim authorisation for the gear shift. We were thrilled to think by today, Monday, the parts will be ordered which as confirmed, takes 5 days. January and our leave is almost over, but hey we'll take what we can get.

Today I receive a call from the panelbeaters who were to fit the gear shift. They were stunned to find out that we are based in Cape Town, as they are based in Clanwilliam! Not to mention, Audi Centre has not received any communication from Discovery to confirm the claim authorisation, or that the car may be moved. Why you chose to have some other business repair the vehicle and order parts, when Audi has provided the quote in the assessment report, is beyond me!

Our car is standing there for almost a month. Is this funny? Discovery's standards have dropped so much. The disappointment is overwhelming.",2
"Marvin is always a great help, always bubbly and makes sure that we get our queries sorted out.",5
"Be vigilant as Discovery Insure rejects claims ""Cover not taken up"" but the specific cover was never offered and I was told I have fully comprehensive cover yet that was not the case. I have lodged a complaint via email, received an auto-response that I will get a response with 24 hours which did not happen. I also requested a copy of the telephonic conversation which they are not providing.

Also note that unlike other insurers that want to keep their client, Discovery Insure WILL increase your premium if you happen to need to claim for a certain period of time. Their premiums are lower than other insurers on on average but the cover is not to be used or they will send you a letter to increase your premiums with 30%!",1

"Absolutely Pathetic service from discovery insure on Friday 14 Jan 2022 in the morning i hit a pothole which caused the wheel of my vehicle to come off and damage the vehicle. 

Help24 towtruck came around on instruction of discovery to tow the vehicle to the assessment center, up until now i do not know where my vehicle is. I had to contact a broker friend that works with discovery to help with this matter. She found out that Help24 never towed the vehicle to the assessment center but rather towed it to their yard. 

I have been mailing my ""claims admin"" and calling non stop to find out from discovery where my vehicle is, what is the status of my vehicle, what is happening with my claim and what is the way forward. But nothing. 

Additionally i pay for the car hire benefit, i tried to access this when registering the claim, all of a sudden discovery tells me i need to pay a massive deposit for the car hire. NOWHERE IN ANY OF THE POLICY DOCUMENTS is there any mention of deposit for car hire. This defeats the purpose of insurance if i have to pay for something that i am supposedly covered for.

If i dont have an answer from discovery before lunch today i will be lodging a case of theft and fraud against discovery and help24 for the loss of my vehicle. And i will be reporting this to the insurance ombud.",1

"I am very happy with the service I received from both Thapelo and Jolan Govender.

Thapelo was very thorough and professional when I initially contacted discovery insure. He offered me very good quotes in a speedy and clear manner. Unfortunately, I needed to chat to my wife before I could make a decision.

After chatting to my wife, I called back to your customer care department to move forward with the changes we needed to make to our insurance plans. On my second call I got through to Jolan Govender who was also extremely helpful, patient and efficient. I could hear how busy the call centre is as I could hear ""chaos"" in the background, but Jolan was very calm and remained professional. He went the extra mile and even got me a better premium as well as picked up on the fact that my 3rd party cover for one of my vehicles included an excess. He very quickly amended this and still got me an awesome premium for this vehicle. Awesome work Jolan!

I am very impressed with the level of service, efficiency and professionalism I received from Jolan and Thapelo. If this is the caliber of staff that Discovery is employing then they are definitely destined for great success!

Awesome work gentlemen.",5

"I recently had a hiccup with Discovery Insure and was upset by the service received. I escalated my complaint, and can honestly say I have been blown away by the service received and the effort to rectify my issues.

A big thank to MATHIBEDI CHUEU for the great service.,5
"This has been one hell of a painful process and I have been forgiving all along but I think keeping quiet now will only promote this behaviour going forward.

I had a very small hit and run accident but my fender needed some attention. So I submitted a claim in the fear that there might be something deeper that has been spoilt instead of the small bodily damage that I could see.

I got assisted by A****aker Williams.

It started from the very beginning when after having responded to his email when he asked if I would be needing the courtesy car and I responded and said yes I would be. The day I went to leave my car at the panel beaters, no courtesy car had been arranged from Discovery's side. I ended up having to go to the Avis dealership. What was supposed to take me just over 15 minutes, ended up taking my whole day and I had to submit leave for when I left Avis, it was already after 11 o'clock. According to the email communication, we were supposed to meet at 8:00 at JMJ Bodyworks.

This was the first sign that this guy doesn't read his emails. 

I then got an sms from Avis stating that if I need an extension on the courtesy car, to communicate with my insurance to arrange for an extension.

I then sent an sms confirming that I haven't received word from the Panelbeaters stating that my car is finished so I'd like them to arrange for the extension.

The following day I got a message stating that I could go and fetch my car. I contacted Avis and made sure that the exchange took place but when I got there, they had messed up other things that had nothing to do with what was wrong. 

The Panelbeaters floors are another story and I'll log those ones too. 

When I got my car back, it was a month later.
I then received an sms with an amount for an additional 15 days that was deducted from my bank account.

My policy has up to a month with a courtesy car, and I had the car for a month, but it appears that, after the email that I sent to A****aker, informing him that they should extend the initial rental period, that was ignored once again.

This truly is unprofessional. I have lost count how many emails I have sent to A****aker (Discovery & Avis) around around this issue and I was under the impression that it would be sorted out. It appears it hasn't been.

Truly unprofessional and trying to call him is also useless for you can never get ahold of the actual person that's dealing with your claim. I've gotten promised call backs which I think out of four promises, I only got one. Which wasn't very fruitful either if I'm still incurring things that went wrong after communicating to this level.",1
"I had to log an emergency call to  Discovery Insure due to Burst Tyre on a new car that does not come with a spare wheel. The Agent who managed my claim was Mpho Mamaregane. The agent listen to my problem with care and assured he will do everything possible to deal with my emergency.  True to his word, Mpho called back and approved the claim in 2hours.  Also kept me informed via email. This is one of the best experiences I had with a claim . Mpho cared and dealt with my stress.  Awesome Customer service from Mpho. Thank you Sir, you  deserve all the accolades",5
"I would like to formally lay a complaint against Discovery Insure. 

I was in an incident on the 7th of Jan 2022 whereas my vehicle was in water. I immediately called my insurance because that is what they are there for. My vehicle was then towed to the nearest approved panel beater. On the 8th of Jan 2022, my partner who is also the policy holder called Discovery to also ensure all is in order & there will be no issues when it comes to my claim. He was assured by the consultant that we are covered , at no time did anyone indicate that my debit order did not go through, and I need to pay asap as I am still within my grace period. ON the 12th I received an email stipulating need to make payment because my premium was not received. I have been speaking to agents that has been looking at my policy at no time did they tell me this. However as soon as this was received , I made an immediate EFT payment , like I have been doing the past 3 months due to discovery not debiting my account. After this payment was made I confirmed with the consultant & he promised all is in order & I will be covered. I also have recordings that will back up all my statements made.  I have been dealing with Dominic Mdlala and Michelle who advised the accounts needs to just allocate my payment. As per discovery they tried debiting me on the 25th of Dec 2021 – which I have proof that it’s not on my bank statement as a failed debit. This was a public holiday , so this statement made is false as they do not run payments on a public holiday. 

•	The incident took place within my grace period of 15 days 
•	My payment was made within the 15 days grace period (also confirmed by consultant)
•	No consultant indicated or advised I need to make payment, or I would not be covered 
•	My vehicle has been at the Auction Nation & let’s be real , I’ve been in the industry for a long time ,  once a vehicle is written off parts gets taken off the vehicle , I cannot take this car back because there is now additional costs that will incur to me  
•	The vehicle has been standing in water since the time of incident , if they advised sooner that I will not be covered this would’ve minimised the damages by me taking my vehicle at the initial time the incident took place 
•	They allocated my payment to the new month whereas my car is a write off based on their damage & assessment report (So what exactly are they covering) 
•	They allocating the payment on the 16TH Jan 2022 whereas the payment would have reflected on the 12th  Jan 2022 hence within my grace period  (also confirmed by consultant)
•	If a discovery consultant had been efficient & advised me that I am within my grace period & need to make payment asap none of this would’ve occurred 
•	Discovery arranged for my vehicle papers to be collected & for me to sign ownership over only to advise 3 days later they will not pay out. 
•	All of this is because they are incompetent , how do you not advise “your client” that they policy is in arrears after an incident however you are within your grace period & need to pay asap or you will not be covered , this was an oversight on their side not mine therefore I cannot be penalised for their negligence 

If you have any queries, please contact me on the below , I need this matter resolved urgently , I will not be bullied by an insurance that is incompetent and does not care about their clients’ interests only their money. 

Kind regards,",1
"Good Day,

I had signed up for Discovery Insure and was happy with the service until I had to put in a claim. In August last year, my son`s iPhone 8 fell and the LCD screen was cracked. The phone was collected, repair and return back to us, still not working. It took the repair centre THREE times to fix LCD screen. The screen was freezing, jumping around, and the last time there was a line running through the screen even though THEY said it was repaired. On 13th January, the phone gave issues again, and up to now I am still waiting for Discovery to come back to me.

Really bad service.",1
"My Son was involved in an accident with their client, The Company Orkin Environmental Services had one of their employees driving the company vehicle in Port Elizabeth. The employee on the 1st September 2021 ran a red traffic light and collided with my Son. Video footage proves that their client was in the wrong. My Son didn't have his own insurance.

The Company had my Son wasted a month with internal Orkin emails, only to be handed over to Discovery Insure, third party who refuted the claim accusing my accusing my Son of not adhering to and not observing road rules. 
After pointing out in detail through screenshots of the video, they offer an apportionment settlement, 60/40 in my Sons favor.  But they came up with a formula that makes my Son owe them a small amount and then state that they are willing to write it off and suggest that each party sort out their own damages incurred. 
This was rejected by myself, but they maintain their stance. I asked for a repudiation letter and has still not received it. 
It seems Insurances, even when the truth is staring them in the face finds ways to not pay out. 
Orkin Environmental Services are no better in this as they have written it off after speaking to the operations Manager, saying that once the case has been handed over to the Insurance, its out of their hands. But they are the Customer to Discovery, surely with a directive from them, they would cause Discovery Insure to do what is right and pay what is due. 
It seems both Orkin Environmental Services as well Discovery Insure condones the breaking of traffic signals and traffic lights. Can anyone be safe on the road when this type of behavior is allowed by these Companies.",1
"Discovery Insure makes use of the DQ Mapper to track your driving habits. This system would have worked if all the data on the system had been correct. It definitely is not. And it is absolutely useless to try and communicate with them in an attempt to fix the situation. I have been trying for months now - sending data, screenshots and photos of the roads in question. I lose points on my Vitality Profile because of Discovery Insure's inadequate system - not my driving!!!!! I drive 100km/h and the speed limit is 120 km/h. And still after numerous requests, nothing has been done. They promise rewards, but do not deliver on their promises. Because of their own inadequacies.",1

The last time I phoned the consultant said someone will phone me. I am still waiting.

"This guy Anesh has a tendency of going awol on clients when we need him the most.

I needed help in December but he ignored all my messages i ended up being helped by another agent via email as i needed to change my debit date from the 1st to the 15th of every month. 
A debit of R830 went off on the 13th of December 2021 i was fine with that, then on the 15th of January a debit of R1205 went off on my account. 


How a R760 premium every month changes to R1205 puzzles me, i had to reverse the money as R400 from the R1200 taken was for my transport to work. 

can you kindly explain how we got to R1200 for a toyota etios?",1
I would like  to review discovery insurance  please  guys if you have an car insurance  with discovery cancel it now  got involved in an accident on the 5th of December and they towed my car and they never access it and six weeks later they did and then asked me to bring back the curtesy car and right now I don't even have a car to go to work since the car has been sitting with then for 6 weeks without doing anything,1
I had an accident early in January. Really didn't want that pressure. I was already thinking dealing with insurance will take so much of my time. My expectations were exceeded by Mpho Mamaregan. Really one of the most efficient Claims Administrators I have ever worked with. Honestly thank you for making a very stressful situation so much easier,5
"I had lighting struck my home and damaged a number of items, including my pool timer. The insurance assessor Yondela and her Manager Brett indicated that it is not lighting damage and refutes the claim. The timer is less than 3 months old and was working before the incident. I am prepared to get a statement from the Electrician, Pool Service that maintains my pool and me. They stick to a script and would rather lose a client then pay for the fixing. Soon to be ex customer.",1

"I have been a client with Discovery insure for 6-7 years now and with the medical - aid for 20 years. I am also a bank member because i want to save as much money as i can , as i am a disabled pensioner. I claimed once last year for a geyser now the yearly price increase came and they are charging me over R600.00 more a month worked out on there formula ,or thats what they said when i phoned. They are not willing to lower the premium or help in any way. This is a prime example of the strong once again stealing from the poor. Proudly South African my backside, they are a bunch of money grabbing thugs. Even though most of them are still working from home due to covid, they still want to milk us for every penny, May the Ceo get a cramp in a place that he can not reach.",1
Thank you for reducing my premium Discovery Insure. I am a happy client. Thank you to Mathibedi Chueu for calling me. The guy was patient and very helpful,5
Thembi Mahlangu was helpful and insightful from beginning to end. Made the claim and finalisation thereof as seamlessly possible. Was a real pleasure dealing with a person of such efficiency.,5
What a frustrating journey to experience with my double debit. I got double debit for Dec 2021 since the 3rd Jan been calling in for assistance and i am being sent left and right and centre. the level of unprofessional staff you have is very disgusting. i need to escalate the matter in order to get help from your finance as this is going on for 2 weeks now,1
"I would like to recognise Kgomotso Sefume of the escalations team at Discovery Insure Claims. Dealing with her is an absolute joy. She has a way of resolving issues with a seeming ease and her communication skills are unparalleled. She possesses a rare ability to place herself in a clients position and make decisions based on people's quality of life, not according to a manual. She is an asset to the team, I love working with her!",5
"Thibi Chueu from the Retentions department, Great service! :)",5
I am extremely disappointed in the service I am getting from Discovery Insure. Our vehicle was in a  accident in Tembisa on the 15th December there was mob Justice at the accident scene and our driver was fearing for his live and left the scene to protect his own life. Metro police just ignored us and wanted bribes which we refused to pay. Discovery didn't even had the right info on where the vehicle was towed to. The call centre told us the car was towed to Renew it Bedfordview but it wasn't there.The appointed assessor couldn't even find the vehicle for more than 3 weeks I had to go look for it myself when we returned from holiday 5 Jan and I found it within  30min. The assessor was changed on the claim and the new assessor was even worse. It is more than a month later and we just have no communication. Our calls and WhatsApp messages gets ignored. She has a very bad attitude and makes assumptions and makes up stories.  We pay more than R6000 monthly on our vehicles with Discovery and then we get treated like this. I will never recommend Discovery to anyone and will cancel all my policies with them.,1
Thibi Chueu - Best ever service!,5
I have received awesome service from Nomfundo  Sibeko.  She was very friendly and very helpful!,5
"It’s a nightmare to claim from Discovery insure, for a claim that was lodged on the 5th of January- till today my car is not fixed, yesterday I followed up in order to arrange that my car then be fixed where I am, I was notified the person Zezethu assigned to my claim will call me back.. I never received a call and this morning I have been calling twice - have been on hold for almost an hour with no assistance and the second call I was told I am being directed to the person again assigned to my claim - I was on hold for 18 minutes until the phone dropped. I never knew moving to discovery will be such a headache, they are unprofessional and it’s just a nightmare to get a claim sorted - if this is the kind of service we receive I don’t know what will then happen in an emergency. I have lost my trust in this insurance. As I am typing this- my issue has still not been sorted.",1
"I put my claim in on 10 January 2022, and until today, 8 days later, have not heard one word from Insure. When I called in, I was informed that I need to provide proof of ownership, which is in fact lying in the Vault. No service, no communication, not looking into the documents that is on hand...nothing! And being a paying customer since 2012... SHOCKING!!",1
Fantastic service from Mathibedi Chueu !!!!! keep it up !!!!!,5
"I called in for assistance and spoke to MPHO something, he was absolutely unhelpful, inconsiderate, rude and pathetic. In my time of need, he was more interested in what happened. I threatened to change my insurance because of his unwillingness, he said its upto me.",1
"I have been with Discovery Insure for 5 years. I drive a Ford focus 2015 model with a depreciating value. I have not claimed for more than 2 years. Because I don't drive my car that much anymore. I have been working from home for the past 2 years. Let me tell you, Discovery Insure has increased my insurance premium twice in one year. In January 2022, my premium was going to be increased from R2, 100 to R2, 300. I negotiated that my premium be increased to R2, 200 instead . On the 23rd of December 2021 I received an email stating that my premium will be increased by a further 20% on the 1st of February 2022, which means that I will be paying Discovery Insure R2, 600 for 2022. This amount is ridiculous. It's close to a car installment. My premium has increased by 24% in one year, yet I have not claimed in 2 years, My driving has improved, I have had my driver's license for more than 5 years, I don't drive the car that much because I am working from home and the value of the car is depreciating. It's unfair. If possible, please refrain from joining Discovery insure. Discovery Insure is not treating customers fairly and is exploiting customers.",1
Azix McPherson welldone. Outstanding service today 🙂👍🙏,5
"Submitted a claim on the 10th of Jan for a cellphone which was authorized with Ref **********. I was sent a link to Takealot to purchase a cellphone similar to the one I claimed for, there was no voucher. The consultant indicated that the voucher will be loaded the following day at 12pm. To date, there is no voucher and the consultant has gone AWOL, he is no longer responding to my emails. This is not the kind of service one signed up for.",1
"This is to seek intervention regarding an accident related claim which is currently pending. The issue I have is with the consultant who supposedly is to assist with the claim. There's no communication from the appointed consultant. He is just not proactive. I am not sure maybe he's swamped with lots of claims but a proper communication will be appreciated. He is not responding/acknowledging emails. There is just no feedback received, even when I call in and leave a message to be called back that is mission impossible with this particular consultant?",1
Agent MATHIBEDI CHUEU was able to assist me promptly and manage to resolve my query.,5
I met with an accident on 27 November 2021. I had logged in discovery app on 29 November 2021. It took discovery 10 days to get my vehicle assessed and another 10 days to get authorisation. The claim consultant was not giving any feedback. I had asked for car hire which was given on 3rd then team leader just sends an email on 14 january saying to go and drop the vehicle no prior notification what so ever as i was using the vehicle for work. I have emailed 3 people asking for a claims manager to call no response. I am very disappointed with Discover insure as feedback is very poor its now gone over 1 1/2 months no vehicle to use gor work and my vehicle is still not repaired and no feedback. No calls no email from them. I am appalled. I have never had a bad experience with Discovery but this now makes me think twice should i continue with them,1
"Claim settled and paid by 24th December (Portion over and above vehicle finance settlement). Good service in general, but it is the 17th of January now and Wesbank has not received payment as yet and is still debiting my account for the vehicle finance. When simply just requesting the confirmation of payment to the finance house the call gets dropped constantly or there is silence on the other end when getting through to a claims consultant at Discovery Insure.",1
"Had an motor accident on 01/01/2021, car was taken to a Discovery approved panel beater. After two weeks, i was told that the panel beater was not on their list and i should uplift the vehicle at my own cost. After many calls and emails, Discovery then advised that the panel beater is approved, 1 month later. Car was fixed 3 months later, claims consultant wanted to pay me out for this claim numerous of times even when the car was in my possession. Vehicle repairs were not up to standard, ended up sending the vehicle back. Shoddy workmanship is very evident. Car is still not repaired correctly. A PI was appointed to assess my car and confirmed the same, as the other clients also had issues with the repairer in question. Fast forward 17/01/2022, still waiting on Discovery to advise. More than 50 emails and numerous calls. Claims team, wants me to take it back to the same repairer. This level of service is beyond pathetic. I am not sure how in this day and age companies like this still exist. I honestly have run out of options, escalated this matter numerous of times and still have a car with doors that don't close properly. I have lodged the same with the ombudsman.",1
"Excellent service from Jabulile Shiba, highly recommend",5
"It is always a great pleasure speaking to Prince Sibiya @broker servicing, Very professional and goes all out to assist, Great asset to the organization indeed. :-)",5
"1. I processed a claim for a windscreen replacement. Discovery approved the claim and got PG Glass to offer me an inferior low qrade cheaper windscreen. I refused and requested a OE/OEM windscreen. Discovery then rejected my request, only for them to get back to me and tell me that the low grade cheaper windscreen is not manufactured for my vehicle.  PG Glass then replaced my windscreen that Discovery approved, however the HUD does not reflect correctly. The incorrect windscreen was ordered. I immediately called Discovery, they spoke to the PG installer wo advised that the windscreen was not a HUD windscreen/poor quality glass. The consultant advised that Discovery would get back to me, but needed MANAGMENT approval to get the CORRRECT windscreen.  Its 5 days now, and NO RESPONSE from  Discovery, except 2 SMS messages advising that the installation of windscreen is complete. Today I spEnt 20 min on HOLD..and was transferred from 1 department to another without ANY HELP.

2. Apple watch replacement : >2 month to replace. Discovery attempted repairing a non repairable watch and I had to go back and forth to the store to collect and drop off this watch 5 times...Was even told that the battery was faulty and I had to pay for a new battery. Eventually, watch was replaced as much cost and time to me.

3. Tire Blow Out while on holiday with family: Was told that no towtrucks available, that had to drive to nearest town40km away. On request for rental vehicle to get home, was told that I cannot leave the province i was in with rental vehicle. No offer to process a pothole claim, due to bad roads. I opted to drive to the nearest town (40km away), find a 20inch a temp tyre, drive to resort and next day order a new tyre and have mag wheel repaired in Nelspruit all at my own cost.

3, Policy detail not updated. I updated policy details and removed items off my policy. This did not happen and I was being charged for items removed from my policy. When I discovered this I called Discovery and requested an explanation as to what happened, as well as a copy of my telephone conversation requesting policy changes. In addition a refund of the monies taken for items removed off my policy, Its been over 6 MONTHS now and NO FEEDBACK/NEWS from Discovery.

4. Another apple watch replacement: Claim was approved for replacement after weeks of follow up.. Watch insured for R6000. Discovery offered R4000. I accepted. Voucher received for 3250, I rejected voucher due to fact that item was loaded onto vault. My email and calls to Discovery were ignored. I requested to talk to a supervisor, who refused to talk to me. Eventually emailed the supervisor (Tatum van Staden) with nor response form her or the claims administrator. Called numerous times and insisted that item was on my locker. When i relooked at my locker, the item was removed, together with other items in my locker. I insisted and requested that Discovery check with their IT department that the item was loaded, provided the date when I loaded the item. Eventually, weeks later, Discovery agreed that the items were loaded and deposited the access in to my bank account without my consent. I would have preferred a voucher for the difference in replacing the watch, which I requested via email. I now had to call Discovery back as the price of the watch had changed and now I needed a another voucher. I am still waiting a reply to my email form Tatum van Staden as to what happened to my locker.

Frustration beyond frustration dealing with Discovery Insure. Be warned....I've heard from fairer skinned friends that their items (apple watch was replaced in 2 days, and that they received vouchers that allowed them to buy their watch plus and an accessory. This to me seems indiscriminate behaviour from Discovery.

My emails to Discovery are not replied, my request for rejection of OE windscreen rejected without any explanation (Explanation : MANGEMENT REJECTION, my request for return calls from supervisor not done, apparently had a sore throat and still has after weeks, 

I was stupid by switching my insurance form a cheaper better service provider to Discovery, I will be switching back again.",1

After using a drive service to drop my kids, I called the emergency line for a jump start. Within 15 minutes my car was ready to go to the nearest battery shop. I was so impressed. By 9h30 I was back home and sorted out. Thank you Discovery. Not the first time you've come to my rescue. Always quick and efficient with your assist line.",5
Insure policy was cancelled yet you continuously debit my bank account resulting in massive bank fees on my account! This is absolutely ridiculous!,1
Great services from Mathibedi Chueu from the retentions department.,5
Thanks Shamanie Naidoo for the great service and for always assisting me with my reinstatement's for our Discovery Insure clients,5
Excellent service from Joelene Scholtz early on a Saturday morning sending out First Help to jump start my battery. Always called back as promised and also a check in to ensure all is fine.,5
Stellar service from Mathibedi Chueu from retentions at Discovery. He is always friendly and professional. Keep the good work.,5
"Driving on the N2 back home on the 8th of January 2022, I struck a piece of iron that cracked my bottom grill and ripped the sump. 
Phoned the emergency line where they sent me a towing vehicle. Towed me to pine town to a Discovery  holding yard. 
I asked for my courtesy vehicle but was told there is none available except at Durban Airport and they won't be able to deliver because it is Saturday afternoon. I was stuck +-40km from Durban. I had to phone a friend living in Pietermaritzburg 70km away who loaded all my stuff and took me to Durban the next day...paid R1500 for the courtesy for the car.
I drove to Ramsgate to stay with family while they repair the sump. Monday when I phoned Discovery they told me they wait for the assessor report....I phoned again on the 11th, they were still waiting, I phoned the assessors myself who didn't even know where the vehicle was...I had to give them the address. 
When I phoned the yard they had my car on a wrong GP registration instead of MP and the front letters were wrong...information that came from Discovery.
The assessors phoned me the next day informing me they have sent the report. Discovery can take up to 48 hours.
I phoned Discovery twice holding for hour...no one picked up...by this time my phone time ran out
Borrowed family phone. Tried again, nothing...no one picked up on Friday morning or afternoon...so I sent them a mail to their 24hr response complaining...still received nothing.
Phoned the yard in Pine Town because I wanted volkswagen to come and tow my vehicle for repairs...just to hear my vehicle was released...I phoned the towing company who gave me the address of the panel beater shop my car was at....when they confirmed that my vehicle is in fact there....they told me discovery has not yet approved repairs...when I opened my Discovery app, it still showed pre-approval...
Today is the 17th....still no reply...
This states there is 0 customer support...you as the customer must do the call time, follow up time and wait time....while it cost you a bunch each day, but they are fast to collect your monthly payments.....
I suggest Discovery take time and focus on CUSTOMER SERVICE...",1
I would like to share my experience from Discovery Insure this week. I had my first claim on my policy and the assessor Riaan Whitney was very friendly and assisted me so quickly. For my first claim in years I have to say it was the best service anyone can ask for.,5
Willie Scholtz helped me when my car got damaged next to a very busy road and made the process easy.,5
"Pleasant, and quick service.  Joelene Scholtz Assisted me and made sure I got the help I needed. Appreciate it",5
"The worse service a have ever received from an insurance company ...claim was locked the 22 December 2021 and my fridges was only repaired 13 January 2022. We had to life almost 2 week's without a fridge...not one call back from the insurance or my broker ..not even asking it the problem was fixed or sorted out ..be careful people what they promise and what they deliver ,differences",1
"I have always experienced excellent service from Discovery, hence they are my insurance of choice. Last week I requested to cancel my policy with them as I felt the annual increase was too much for me. My mistake was not realizing how much add ons I had which increased my premium. Called discovery to reinstate the policy after realizing a lot of the charges were add ons & not related to my car. Shamanie Naidoo was awesome. She reinstated my policy, explained my excess funder will be reinstated, checked my vitality drive and offered to help with my Eyegym which I previously experienced issues with. Excellent service, the Representative paid attention to detail, reviewed all my details that helped serve me better. I was reminded why I love Discovery.",5
"On the 26th of December 2021 i was involved in an accident where my car was bumped from the rear. My car was moved from the accident scene (Thohoyandou) to Polokwane (Auction Nation) where i was told by a discovery agent that that is where they conduct their assessments. 

Between the 26th and the 30th of December my Tracker device kept on sending me alerts that someone was turning my ignition on and off in the middle of the might and early hours of the morning. I found the whole situation very strange and suspicious to a point where i decided to inform discovery which in turn ignored my concern by not entertaining my emails and a number of calls. 

After a number of days my car was moved from Auction Nation to Elda Panelbeaters for another assessment as mentioned by discovery insure agents. On the 6th of January my tracker device gave me the last alert (Ignition On) , which i also found strange and when i called the Elda i was told it is because of the battery. However, Tracker later informed me that it was not possible for the tracking device to die because of the car battery since it has its own life span of 10 days separate from the car battery. 

Since the day of my accident on the 26th of December, the agent who has been allocated to handle my claim has not given me a single telephonic update on the progress of my vehicle. 

I would like to state that i find the treatment and service from Discovery Insure as inconsiderate, unprofessional, dishonest and inhumane.",1
"I submitted a claim on Thursday morning, I am still waiting on discovery to confirm if my claim is approved. I have been following up with them on numerous occasions but still no progress",1
"Pathetic service. I had communicated several times that my bank details changed, yet they still debited the wrong account and my premiums came back as unpaid. Trying to get a hold of someone is a nightmare and when I finally did speak to a consultant, he was rude, arrogant and sighed audibly while I was talking to him as if it was a pain to do his job. When I told him of my poor experience, he did not even attempt to offer any apology or understanding but rather had a very bad attitude. The only reason I decided to go with Discovery, with its inflated prices is because their service had good ratings but my experience has been nothing but poor. Also, I have been trying to find out why for the last 4 months, my premium was a different amount. When asked this simple question a week ago, they just brushed it off as it being my premium anniversary.... Is every month a premium anniversary?! Absolutely shocking how incompetent and rude the staff are.",1
"I called Discovery Insure for Road Side Assistance and they sent help to me within half an hour! The agent I spoke to, Joelene Scholtz was helpful and expressed great concern towards our safety and well being. Excellent service, will definitely recommend to anyone.",5

"Thanks to Prince Sibiya for always being on Point. His knowledge of systems and procedures is matched only by his amazing service, customer care and professional manner. A true asset to the team, Keep up the excellent work!!",5
"The worst service ever! Why did we change car insurance companies?
My son was in a car accident last year November, Discovery send his car to Renew-It, Sandton. Lets not even start how pathetic their service is! Discovery allowed the car to be released, a day later the cars bumper fell off! The airbag light indicated its malfunctioning and the headlights were different colours! But Discovery thought this is nooo problem. Not the end of the misery by a long shot! The car was returned back to Renew-It. They pronised us, by the end of the day it will be fixed. Day 3, and still no joy. No communication from *****-It,  or Discovery. When my son tried to follow  up from Renew-It, and tried to get some form of fback, from the manager, they dropped the phone in his ear. No help from Discovery side! I lost it eventually and phoned Discovery, arent they suppose to facilutate the process? They noticed our complaints on their system but never, even after my rant, got back to us, or followed it up!
They better go and sign the car off before we take it! If the airbag is malfunctioning after release and something happens to my son in an accident as a result of that, there will be hell to pay!",1
Fantastic Service,5
Mmabohlale is such a great help all the time. She is always friendly and would not mind going the extra mile for me,5
Discovery insure is terrible. I have called every day this week to get my car booked in for repairs and no luck... The Person dealing with my assessment is Aubrey Mofokeng. Terrible service. I have been trying to speak to him since Monday but no luck... he never returns any calls or emails. I have called every day this week and just spent another hour on the phone holding on for Aubrey to be told he will call me back. Discovery is this really the service you want to be sending out to client.... i have no words on how shocking this is.,1
Complimets to Shafick Allow at the Retention department for his excellent service. He answered all my questions and sorted out my queries with kindness and politeness throughout our correspondences. I am very satisfied and will continue being loyal to Discovery Insure. Tshidi Manamela,5

Woke up to a dead car battery. Called Discovery Insure Emergency support and dealt with Moses Malinga from the Emergency Services department. He was super helpful. Called me back in record time. From first call to car running again took 40 mins. Moses also called back to make sure car was working. Really excellent service.,5
It's a pleasure being assisted by Shafiq Allow from retentions at Discovery. He is extremely detailed and professional and the experience is made even better by the fact that is so friendly and courteous.  A true breath of fresh air.,5
"They refused to do a early debit in December so I called in to do an eft, as I know I'm heading for an annual premium increase I confirmed the amount payable was my normal amount. I was told yes, subsequently now they won't pay my cash rewards because my account is in arrears due to no fault of my own. I have had enough. When you call their ivr says the same thing twice causing me to use more airtime than expected. Absolutely disappointing.",1
Thank you Shamanie for your efficient and consistent service. I am truly grateful,5

"On the 4th of December I had to call Discovery to tow our vehicle it was damaged by deep water in the road. The baseplate came loose and was crunched up below the Kombi. Our vehicle  stood for almost a week at the towing company before being driven to the assessors (in the damaged condition). It the took  another week for repairs. We finally got it back at 16:30  on the 17th of December. When we got home, we noticed our back bumper is now sporting two large cracks very clearly from incorrect towing. I immediately contacted the claims consultant to inform her of the situation.  To make matter worse, the next morning as I wanted to start the car a full pulley with the mounting fell out of the engine onto my driveway. I immediately emailed our claims consultant Nqobile and phoned her the following Monday. Seeing as all the mechanics were closing for Christmas there was not much to be done except getting a courtesy car again. 

The new year came around and on the 4th of January I phoned Discovery again to hear what is happening with our vehicle. Further calls were made on 5 January, 10 January, 11 January and on 12 January. Every time a promise is made that a call back will follow. This is after calls are dropped twice per day and you have to start the whole process again. I do not want to even calculate how much airtime we have spent. On 10 and 11 January, I was assured the seevice provider appointed to fix the car will collect the car from my house, but to date the car is still in my driveway. 

Not once has any of the claims consultants phoned us back like they said they would, the service provider appointed has still not come to pick up our vehicle and we have no idea what is happening to rectify the damages caused by the service provider Discovery appointed. Lerato, Nellie, Kaylene, Nqobile, Cindi (perhaps Cynthia) and Lesego apparently do not think it important enough to answer or call back their paying clients, despite making many promises. Getting to talk to a manager is impossible. Extremely disappointed and would not recommend Discovery vehicle insurance to anyone because when their service providers damage your vehicle you are on your own",1
Great service from Wanda Mdunyelwa. You are a star,5
"Great service from Jade Matjeke, truly 5 star!",5

"Terrible service from discovery asked them to upgrade my car rental to an automatic. I also asked them to calculate the difference as I would pay it, the calculations were incorrect. Avis wanted 3k upfront which is not what discovery told me. None of my instructions were followed. Avis dropped off a manual vehicle. I haven’t driven a manual in 4 years. I called them two days before I dropped my vehicle with panel beaters.",1
Prince Sibiya: Very quick and efficient service and thankfully stayed on the line to ensure the issue was rectified on my side.  He is the type of agent that we need in broker servicing so we are not kept on the line for ages sorting out problems.,5

"On the 15th of December 2021 there was a massive storm in Durban where a number of houses were affected by a lighting strike in my area. 

We had contacted our brokers at 1618 to let them know that we have a number of items that were affected by this incident. 

My husband and I have been discovery insure clients for a number of years and have never had a hassle with dealing with them, up until this claim. 

There was no professionalism. The claim was assigned to someone and then reassigned to Ntokozo Wendy Radebe on the 23rd of December. 

Being the festive season we understood there may be skeleton staff around. So we waited. The number provided for Ntokozo was incorrect and I could not get ahold of her I had to email her in order for her to contact me. She had not contacted me at any point before I asked for contact. 

Ntokozo had said that she will process the items accordingly. They had been sourcing items from people in Potchefstroom and Durban noting that these people only supply and do not install. Two of the main things that were affected by the storm were our CCTV and DSTV. 

There were was an item that Ntokozo had told us they could not supply and stated that they would provide us the cash to purchase it. To my surprise the valuation of this item was just above half of what the item costs. I had asked her where she had gotten this evaluation from she said from the internet. My son had then checked and she was getting her price from BidOrBuy and the item was stated to be used/refurbished. We do not pay a premium for discovery insurance for the consultants to undervalue our items and want to provide us with refurbished or used items. I do not think this is correct. More so we had to find the price of a version of this item brand new and send it to her in order for it to be paid out correctly. 

To add to this she is telling us that certain things are not covered by discovery , though we have all the building cover , content cover and power surge cover on our policy. We had to tell her this and then only were certain things been told to be assessed. 

She has now also paid out an incorrect amount for a portable possession item which was claimed for and evaluated which we also pay a premium for and has closed our claim stating that we informed her that we did not want to proceed with it !! This is definitely not correct! She had not contacted us not consulted us before the claim was closed as we are still awaiting service providers to come in and evaluate certain things. 

Ntokozo would call me after hours as according to her she was “too busy during the day” and after my third call with her requested that I “do not call her after 6pm”. The contact details for her do not work , the only way of contacting her was via her email. 

Discovery has now show me and my husband absolutely pathetic service on this claim and extreme unprofessionalism by their claims consultants.  

Please can people be wary of how their items are evaluated by discovery’s consultants as refurbished items are not what we are paying for nor a premium for absolutely horrendous service",1

"I am already a Discovery client which makes this complaint even worse. I keep getting phone calls from Blue Mercury Financial Services Providers on a regular basis. 

I have asked numerous times for them to blacklist my number in their database but they keep phoning me to sell me stuff I already have. 

I have spoken to Stephan Herbst in the Complaints Resolution Officer Retail Distribution department. Clearly he can do nothing for me since he has said multiple times that the lead generation party uses an old list.  

BUT

This complaint is directed towards Discovery since I am on Your database, You were suppose to protect my privacy as your client which you just went and gave to a lead generation company without my consent and this is what caused this whole mess in the first place. 

I am honestly considering cancelling all my ties with Discovery at this point. 

Blue Mercury is Damaging to Discovery's reputation. 

Do something about it.",1

"My complaint is for the charge of R869.57 for ""overdue rental"" that I was charged by AVIS  but I never kept the car longer than I should have.
I was lead to believe by Discovery Insure that I could keep the car until the 24th of December 2021 as per confirmation sent by Natasja Badenhorst, but it was taken from me on the 16th December 2021 by Avis because they never received a request for extension from Discovery. I informed Discovery of this and was ensured that I would not be liable for any rental costs. When I received my invoice from Avis there was the charge mentioned above which I believe that I am not liable for as I never returned the car late.
Why would this specific charge be for my account whereas I was not the one responsible for it?

I contacted Discovery abiut this and to dste have not received any feedback from them after I was promised 2 weeks ago that they would look into it. I am very disappointed in the handling of this matter and want my money returned to me as soon as possible.",1

"Considering how much they brag about their customer service and innovation, Discovery highly underdelivers. 
I had an accident in April 2021. Discovery sent my car to a repairer twice as far as ones in my area (that are listed with Discovery). Said repairer then delivered the most appalling service - poor communication, bad repairs, breaking other things, etc. After lodging a complaint with Discovery it took all of 5 months before they agreed to have another repairer rectify the issues left on my car.
3 months after providing a quote for the rectifications the new repairer and I have still not gotten authorisation to go ahead with the repairs. So in the meantime I'm driving around with broken things on my car.

I originally dealt with Khumo Maruping who did not help much, so Dominic Madlala took the case over. He hasn't been any better. There are over 70 emails where I try to get this resolved. On top of that I can see the assessor's are also frustrated by the lack of cooperation from Discovery.

This past week alone I spent 50 minutes (mainly on hold waiting for someone to answer) calling them. I spoke to Yolanda and Peter in the Specialised Claims department who both promised to send authorisation the same day - still nothing in my inbox.",1

"I have had thee most unpleasant claim with Discovery Insure.  I had a car accident on the 22nd of November 2021, I still don't have my vehicle repaired and back. They admitted to delaying the assessment of the car after the accident by 6 days, it took 2 whole weeks, before I received confirmation that the car has been assessed. The communication is little to none, with nothing helpful being done in the meantime. The car hire is said to be valid for 30 days only, if the car is taking almost 2 months in their repair process, what is supposed to happen after that 30 days? I pay for car insurance, as well as a car installment, how exactly should I commute? I have been emailing the claim consultant Thovhowani, who claims his manager Kagiso is copied on the emails, since December, I have not heard a word from that manager. They extended the car hire by 6 days, as they claim they delayed the process by 6 days, this helps nothing, as I still don't have my car and Avis wants their rental back? their delay on the assessment caused he ripple effect of delays on the entire process, who is now supposed to account for that? My broker PSG is as silent as night on the email communication, at this point, I'm not entirely sure what their role is, if not to sort things out on my behalf with Discovery. I'm so exhausted of following up, fighting, enquiring. Who at Discovery is going to help with the extension with Avis, as well as communicate adequately?",1

"I had a very traumatic home invasion on the 17th December 2021 after speaking to Abdul Christian he assured me if I send all my details and documents he will handle the claim and make sure a speedy claim.

Abdul promised to call on numerous occasions and just did not, the lack of care for customer surely is suppose to be better then this.
I have never done a claim of this nature before, this was not a good experience and this really added to our stress that we have experienced.

"I joined Discovery Insure in June with the policy starting 1 July. As part of their sales pitch they promised me 50% back of of my contributions for the first six months in December and never ever mentioned that it will not apply if it started in July.

I never got paid this amount and when I queried I got am email from them stating:
Kindly be advised that the campaign was for policies that started from the 1 April 2021 till the 30 June 2021.

They never mentioned that when they sold the policy to me, otherwise I would have joined in June. This was misinformation to sell policies. It was an agency from Durban that sold me the policy and I insist on them getting the recordings from the sale.

Their systems does not work as promised. They have never linked my wife's card to fuel back refunds. I raised that with them, but are still waiting for a response.

Nobody explained to me exactly how to manage my account on their website. Their website is a nightmare. They do not receive all fuel claims and make it my responsibility to check and upload claim not on the system. I tried to upload a claim once, but it failed. Most of the times services are not available on their website.

I did training on their website and it crashed after I completed the training and I had to repeat it.

In principle it sounds good, but in reality it is a nightmare. I never thought I had to check and manage my own fuel claims.

I asked them to call me back at a certain time, but they called me before that. The second time they called, the call got disconnected. I then called them again and spoke to an agent that promised to call me. It seems like when they call a client and there s no answer they think they have done their job.",1
I had a great experience and was assisted by Willie Scholtz who called me regularly to ensure that everything was sorted until the road side assistance arrived. Thank you for the great service,5
Excellent services from Shafick Allow from the retentions Department,5
I put in a claim over a week ago because I had water streaming into my dining room and one of my bedrooms after a storm. I was told someone would contact me later that day. No one did. I called the next day to find out what happened and was told that they will escalate the issue. I still haven't heard from them a week later. I'm considering cancelling my insurance with them.,1
"In the December 2021 I drove into a pool of water when I was joining the highway. Discovery took my car for assessment and last week the declined to pay my claim stating few reasons.
1. It is impossible for water to reach the part of the engine which got damaged.
2. Some where around or in the engine they found water which has no soil or salt, meaning its fresh water.
3. I continuously attempted to start the car although there were warning lights/ message indicating the car cannot proceed any further.

This was so heartbreaking and disappointing on my side.
For the fact that I went into a pool of water on 4 Dec and it caused the car to stop should be an indication of how much water was on the road. The fact that they say water that was found which also contributed to damages was fresh it's   unbelievable. To start with rain water does not have salt and  if it's a pool of water, it's obvious there will not be any soil in the water. Also noting that this assessment was done after 15 days. Technically the water would have evaporated by then if it's true. Regarding me attempting to restart my car a number of times. That is human nature. I have never driven that model before and never been in that situation before. Every normal person will attempt restarting their car if it switches it's self off. At that moment I was stressed, panicking and anxious. I was also worried that onother car can come from behind and bumb me as I was stuck in the middle of the road on a curve. My concern was my life and avoiding a collision.

I believe that the decision taken by discovery it's completely unfair. 

Also. 2 assessment was done on the car but only the one that claims negligence was presented to me.
I have requested the 2 reports to be made available to me. Now discovery say I must sign a declaration that the reports  are for my eyes only and I cannot share them with anyone except a legal representative. But I must first ask permission from discovery to share that information with a legal representative.
Which got me asking my self the validity and facts behind the reports. Example. If it was a car crash and discovery got  a medical report indicating that I drove under the influence of alcohol, would they have asked me not to share the Dr's report with any one?

In short, that's my sad and bad experience with Discovery insure which was assessed by their own people and it was not taken to BMW for facts


Oooh. To add a cherry on top. My car went in with no visible/ major damages on the body. Went the towing truck brought it back. There is a big dent on the rear left bumper. I send photos on Wednesday. Till today, it's just silence.",1

"I had an accident on the 3rd Dec 2021, on that same day Discovery called to say the claim had been approved and my car written off (great start) - wrong! Since then I have dealt with at least 6 consultants and sent at lease 30 emails, result NOTHING.. Trying to talk to someone is a joke, you get put on hold for 15 minutes, then cut off. Trying to escalate anything to someone in management is a joke, I don't think they exist - it has taken 5 weeks just to get the name of a ""Team Leader"", not management. They are obviously happy to leave their business in the hands of their useless staff. I am very frustrated and mostly disappointment, having been a client for more than 10 years, this type of service is just plain disgusting. In this time of technology, this claim should not have taken more than 2 weeks at more. Goodbye Discovery from me and as many of the people I have recommended you to as possible.",5
"I had an emergency in the middle of a busy road and reached out to Discovery Insure. Wanda Mdunyelwa, the consultant who assisted me, was very helpful and kept checking up on me throughout the day. Thank you so much for caring and for making sure that my car was towed and that I got home safely.",5
"I've had an absolutely fantastic experience with Discovery Insure so far. I was in a car accident on Christmas Day and logging the claim on the app was quick and easy. Despite this happening over the Christmas/New Years period there has been minimal delays from their side. I went to the Discovery Menlyn assessors yesterday and they were so incredibly friendly and helpful, even helping me get my Vitality set up and doing the health checkup for me while my car was being assessed. As an added bonus, they even gave me a free screen protector for my phone!

My claims handler A****aker Williams from the Sandton branch has been there with me every step of the way with a professional yet personable approach, really going the extra mile for me on this. 

Being in the insurance industry myself, I know that clients can so easily slip through the cracks but Discovery and especially A****aker has made me feel like a valued customer.",5
Great help and kindness from MATHIBEDI CHUEU,5

Have an insurance claim with Discovery they refuse to pay me but instead replace the TV when I told the consultant that want to get another make TV.  Discovery decline the request and refer asked there provider to replace the TV which I also disagree with as the model is no longer available but is replacing the TV at a cheaper value.  Becareful as this was the first time I ever claimed yet othrt insurance gives you the money for the replacement.  Not happy with Discovery as I clearly asked for my insurance to include power surge etc now the consultant advised I dont have this.  Left 3 message since yesterday and nobody has called.  Definitely going to cancel my insurance with Discovery,1
"My partner had recently taken a vehicle insurance with Discovery Insure. When we requested a quote for the new insurance policy they constantly called us and were always eager to answer questions. Then we had a minor accident in December and needed to put through a claim. We used the app to put through the claim and a courtesy vehicle was offered since our vehicle would be going in for inspection. The towed our vehicle on the 22nd December and no one not even a consultant at Discovery contacted us to tell us where our vehicle is or what is going on. On the 30th we called to get an update on the vehicle and we were told that the inspector wasn't sent out. The inspector only went out on the 31st to assess the vehicle. On the 4th January we called again and they said further assessment was going to take place on the 4th. I find it so unprofessional for a company like Discovery to not provide any feedback to a client, the client needs to constantly call them in order for them to take action and move to the next step of the process. I am utterly dissatisfied and annoyed by the level of service Discovery has offered us.",1
Wanda Mdunyelwa was an absolute star. We called experienced car problems around  20h00 on the 2nd and called  road side assistance helpline. Wanda calmly attended to my query and promised to call back asap he had located a service provider. He kept track of the case and checked on us until we were towed safely home..he even called afterwards to ascertain that we have indeed been dropped off safely.. Thanks Wanda fir your efficiency and calm spirit. God bless u.,5

We have been promised on multiple occasions that the matter would be resolved, that they are awaiting a report and then now waiting a quotation.  The frustration is that no one calls to update on the matter, and one is promised multiple call backs and no one actually puts in the effort to call back.  They answer phone like they doing you a favor and that you being unreasonable.  No one advised that the electrical company closed over the holidays and promised that they will get back to us soon,  never happened.  On the 3rd January 2022 i was promised by the consultant that she will call me back on the 4th,  its the 5th and no one has called.  

I was referred to my broker,  Angelinah Dube,  her number transfers be to Discovery bank,  emailed her she never responded.  Got an sms to liaise with Chante Davids,  She never answers her calls,  never returns calls.  Discovery homeowners insurance is just useless.  They want to wait till there is more damage and an escalation before they take a matter seriously.  Second claim service  is worst then the 1st of which i didn't even get an apology for and doubt that this time around it would be any different.  

If you don't have telephone etiquette and timeous response to matters and least have the decency to resolve the problem.",1
I would like to thank Shamanie Naidoo for her assistance on policy **********. She was very efficient and friendly. Other agents could learn from her. Keep up the good work.,5
"My discovery insure cover on my 3 vehicles and household content commenced on the 14th of Dec 2021 and the consultant I spoke to on the 1st of December 2021 told me that I will be debited on that date (14 December 2021) knowing that the normal debit date is the 25th of every thereafter. To my surprise, I got an email on the 30th of December 2021 saying my plan had lapsed because of a missed premium. When I went to check on my bank statement I noticed that they did not debit on the 14th as they had said, instead they attempted to double debit me on the 25th. Now, for the 25th I had made sure that there are enough funds for one debit, because even a few days before the 25th I got an sms from Discovery reminding me about my debit order for the 25th (which was the amount I know that needs to be debited). So now how do you say you debiting on the 14th, then send an sms before the 25th for a specific amount only to debit more than that, Basically I was lied to, on both occasions and to think the only reason why I even switched to Discovery is because of the great service I receive on my other Discovery products.",1
SAFIYAH FONDLING gave me excellent service,5
"I spoke to retentions department  Shamanie Naidoo
I received excellent service rand advise from her and would like to applaud her for sorting out my issue and reassuring me to stay with discovery
Much appreciated",5
"i am so disappointed in this company, i was covered with budget insurance from 2018 until last year when I decided to move to discovery because I felt like I was paying too much for a car that's losing  its value, the process of moving from 1 insurance to another was perfect. 

December 13th 2021 after work I was involved in a car accident and my car is a write off, after the day of the accident I had to call discovery non stop I was given an claims agent by the name of Sandile Mbatha, he never called me to take my statement as to what happened during the scene. I had to call and give my statement  since the accident I am supporting my network provider because I have to call the call center and wait on the line for more then 40mins and the agent are not sure as it what's planning with my claim they tell me that they need to escalate with different departments.
the only time Sandile Mbatha called me was when i spoke to  Busisiwe and Nqobilem and I asked that my claims consultant to be changed because I once asked him to call me and he never did and he didnt bother to email me back when he asked me to send him the change of ownership form because I didnt attached the Nas I HAD TO CALL THE CENTER AGAIN AND THATS WHEN THEY TOLD ME THAT I HAVE TO ATTACH THAT FORM 
Another thing when i call the center and ask how much is the value of my car they all dont KNOW (so far I got R102.00, R94 000 and R104 000)
When I called in last week not sure which day was it cause I call in almost everyday I was told the model of my car is 2014 but MY CAR IS A 2015 MODEL SO THE QUESTION IS WAS I PAYING FOR A 2014 MODEL SINCE I JOINED THIS COMPANY
I called in again today and i was told it was not changed! and that lady I forgot to take her name promised that she will send me the agreement of lose form today before she knocks off at 6pm still nothing 
i am so disappointed and I am afraid the claim  wont be resolved before month end",1
"This has to be the most incompetent insurance company. Fortunately I am not insured with you, but the guy who drove into the back of me is. This happened on 20 October 2021 and we are still waiting for discovery to sort their act out. My car still has not been repaired and quite frankly Gretchen ... who my husband has been dealing with is quite incompetent too. Why is it that when someone is not at work or on Leave there isn't someone  to assist. I would not recommend discovery for insurance at all. This is very disappointing and not what is expected of Discovery as I have been happy with my medical aid.",1
Best advise and assistance from Shafick Allow at Retention department. Thank you so much,5
"SAFIYAH FONDLING was really helpful in understanding the premiums and
 the differences between the different vehicles that I have insured. Her help was excellent. This is why I keep insuring with Discovery.",5
This rating is specifically for Shamanie Naidoo who always goes the extra mile!!,5
"completely disappointing! We have been with Discovery since its INCEPTION! but it is pathetic. When the agent does not know or has a challenge, they just cut you off. SO DISAPPOINTING! and I will bet the management does not have a clue! just make the money, but pass it on to someone who has no clue!!",1
Very efficient assistance and a very nice person.,5
"So Discovery out of the blue decided increase my monthly premiums starting from February. With some nonessential explanation about things that I believe have nothing to do with me. Keep in mind that the annual review and high probability of an increase again in September is on the horizon. Yesterday, I send them a tweet and the responded via DM and informed me that they’re only increasing premiums of those that had several claims in the last three years. I’ve only had two claims in the last two years that I’ve been with Discovery. I am not sure if that could be construed as several. A scratch on the door as well as a windscreen chip(which was fixed and never replaced) I’ve asked them to have their consultants phone me and I am still waiting. I am extremely disappointed and disheartened by this. I am even considering switching to another insurance. I do not believe that what Discovery is doing falls under TCF. In fact I am annoyed and I won’t be recommending Discovery insurance to anyone.",1
"Thank you Shafick Allow from Discovery Insure Retentions department for brilliant service  and being able to reduce my client's insurance premium.  
It is greatly appreciated.
thank you Shafick",5
"So I am currently insured with outsurance, and through a friend I heard about discovery insurance. Everything sounded good while they complimented the terrific services they received. So my friend gave me their broker's ( Igshaan Ismail)  contact information and I phoned him the following day to get a quote for insurance. 2 days later I received a quote and decided to sign with discovery insurance. So I contacted Igshaan Ismail and informed him that I want to sign and how do we go about in canceling with outsurance, 
to which he replied that he will handle it all and that I don't have to worry. The reason is I wanted all my policies and medical aid under one umbrella. So after I signed he contacted me and said that I need to contact outsurance and cancel myself. Ok so I phoned outsurance and my broker at outsurance re evaluated my policy and gave re generated a quote. New contribution that was given to me was better that discovery to which I could not say no. And everything stays the same. So I then contacted Igshaan again and explained that I can not say no to this offer and he asked me what the new premium is, so I  told him and he said ""yes discovery will not be able to beat that"", and he also suggested that I stay with outsurance and that he understands. So i asked him to please cancel the insurance policy and he informed me that I just need to email him with the policy number and that I want to cancel. I did this immediately and asked on the mail to please confirm that he received the mail and that it is canceled. This was done on the 17th of December 2021. I have sent numerous emails to him and whatsapp's that is ignored. I have sent all correspondence to *********** and all I get is an automated email to say you have received the mail. We are going  on to 3 weeks now with no outcome or confirmation. A debit order went off this morning which I already reversed. Hello peter is my first step, ombudsman also will be contacted as this is really unprofessional. I have a medical aid and life policy and I am so happy and satisfied. But insurance side? I am very happy that I decided to stay with outsurance, if it takes 3 weeks to get correspondence what would have happened if i decided to stay with the insurance and really needed them?",1
"These people do not understand ""remove my number from the system"" i keep getting spam calls from them. no i do not want to have discovery insurance, and since you phone so much i will Never use them. - atleast 3 calls again last 2 weeks.",1
"I have had the worst experience yet with Discovery. My claim was submitted on the 6th of December 2021. I was told my car was going for an assessment on the 9th. I followed up on the 14th as I had not heard anything further. I was told they could not find my car and my call was dropped multiple times. My car was then only taken for an assessment on the 15th after my father had to call you guys, so because I am a female I wasn't taken seriously either. This is totally unacceptable and pathetic service. Till today the 4th of January 2022 I am yet to hear if my car has been fixed. Imagine having to find atl transportation for a whole month. You can even get my car sorted out in an acceptable time period but you damn well make sure the debit order goes off my account.",1
"Geyser burst, no result and damage caused. Geyser replaced, 10 days later, with a lot of damage caused by contractor. Complained on 18 November 2021, STILL NO RESOLVE. Their negligence has cost me R7400 and an increased premium. Not a happy customer AT ALL",4
"This morning I woke up to a dead car battery. I called Discovery Insure and was assisted by Willie Scholtz. He organised a service provider to assist, and I was kept in the loop the entire time. Following the assistance by the service provider, he still called to ensure all went well. Thanks for the fantastic service Willie.",5
"03 January 2022: What an excellent service from Ms Joelene Scholtz! I received constant status feedback throughout the process until my car was delivered to the Auto Mechanic. Even then, she called to confirm if I'm happy and whether there is any further assistance required. Brilliant service. Many thanks Joelene.",5
"I was involved in an accident on the 06/12/2021. My claim was approved on the 13/12/2021 by then the penal beater had already closed for holidays (They closed on 10/12/2021). I then called Discovery to query about the car hire since I was only given 30 days (06/12/2021 to 06/01/2022). I wanted to know what is going to happen since my car wont even be touched since the repair shop was already closed. I was advised that I will get an extension. The lady assisting me assured me that the only time they dont extend car hire will be when the vehicle was awaiting parts. The repair shop opened today 03/01/2022) and I called Discovery for car hire extension. Busisiwe also assured me this morning that it wont be a problem as the repair shop was closed by the time the repairs where authorized. However I was worried when there was no feedback. I then sent out an email and the lady from FGRO called back and connected me with the claims department. The answer was : No car hire extension will be granted because the Repair shop was closed - Management. I tried calling the Team Leader Natasha no answer, I also tried calling Manager Kagiso still no answer.
 
No one wants to talk or assist me.",1
"after 5 days without a phone, I kept on calling for feedback after being told my claim was approve I still haven't received any assistance, Until this morning after my 6th time calling claims department , Mothokoa Mpya made sure that she will get this matter resolved today, which I am very thankful towards Her, thank you for the excellent service you provide , I failed  to believe I will receive any good service from claims department. 
Thank you Mothokoa",5
Very difficult to deal with - emails are not answered. You get transferred from one department to the next. Very difficult to get hold of anyone to finalize your query. Very disappointed in the service (or rather lack of service!),1
"Once again I have to revert to alternative methods to try and get someone to actually do their job at Vitality Drive!!!! I have sent multiple emails requesting assistance and every person responds without even bothering to read previous communication - not reading the issue and not responding to the problem.  My car doesn't move and then the stupid app records trips and allocates them ""uncovered"". This is bringing my score down, and I work very hard to get perfect trips.  I won't let a malfunctioning app affect my drive score and rewards.  Fix this!!!!",1
I was assisted by Shafick Allow from Discovery Insure Retention Dept.  He spent a significant amount of time explaining to me the different products within Discovery based on my enquiry and guided me on how to evaluate different service offerings within and outside of Discovery.  Super Impressed with his service.  Certainly an asset to be retained by the company.,5
"I'm livid with Discovery Insure. I religiously check my credit report with Clear Score and never picked up anything untoward. Yesterday evening I received one of those adverts from Diect Axis Pulse offering a free Credit Check which I decided to check as I am always trying to find ways to live within my means.

On drawing the credit report,  the very first expense is a Discovery Insure (a fixed cost), with a monthly installment of R6508 (six thousand five hundred and eight rand), which I'm supposed to have had since 1 Dec 2015. Thankfully the account is not in arrears. The thing is, I have never ever asked about/ applied for/ taken  up an insurance with Discovery, NEVER. 

I used to work for the bank and understand how one's spending level and patterns directly impact the interest charged on credit cards, loans, overdrafts etc. My problem is how much has their error cost me over the years... will I ever get reimbursed for any financial loss?

On calling the discovery, the agent confirmed that they do not have me as a client. My query will be escalated and I should get the letter in a day or so which I must forward to the bureau that listed the expense.  

To begin with, why is it now my problem to fix their error. I did not send the info to the bureau they did and should fix their error.

In addition, how 🤔 am I supposed to know which bureau was used (experian/ ITC/ Credit Bureau/ TransUnion/XDS to mention but a few), all I have is the expense listed on my credit report... Am I now supposed to shoot in the dark in hope that I might find the target, spend hours on end calling all the bureaus to ask them to check if they did the capturing. 

As if that not enough, once I find the bureau I  have to lodge a dispute and send all my supporting documents from my ID, proof of address, the 'letter' from discovery, police stamped affidavit and whatever I can think of to support my attestation that I do not have discovery insurance account. After sending all these documents I would still have to wait weeks for the matter to be resolved. Honestly this is financially and emotionally taxing not to mention the hours I have to spend running around in an effort to resolve this issue.

In conclusion, I believe discovery insure should be correcting their erroneous listing, without involving me just like they listed me without my participation. In general, businesses need to take responsibility for their mistakes and not allow the innocent  to climb through hoops and loops. Just as it is so easy for business to submit a report, it should be just as easy to retract erroneous reports without making the innocent suffer.",1
MATHIBEDI CHUEU - Great service. Really friendly and polite.,5
"I have submitted 3 claims 3 weeks ago, received a e-mail that advised I will be contacted 2-3 working days. Received my first response 6 working days later on one of my claims. Second and Third claim response followed 10 working days later with rather confused Discovery staff members.After 4 emails and phone calls to Discovery the Assessor made contact (week no. 2),they requested the 3 quotes + damage reports. This I have already send off to Discovery Insure who claimed they cannot open the Documents wich I send as  (PDF & Screenshot to make it easier for them.Going back and firth into week no. 3 they advised that 3 claims had been rejected, so frustrating as they received the proper paper work (quotes & damage reports). My hard earned money and my Insurer cannot assist me as I am sitting with Fridge, TV and Car that is giving me major problems.I will seek to repair all these items on my own as I need to have my food and transported taken care of. Discovery Insure needs to cange their add on television and work on their communication and customer service.Funny enough the only proper communication from Discovery Insure that was 'Spot-On' was two sms send to my phone reminding me of my 'debit order' that will be going off after the 'public holiday' 27 Dec 2021.So easy to 'debit' but when 'life' happens to you,eish!!!!!",1
"Unreal service by Willie Scholtz and the team at Ontowing - KJ and Frank. 

Thank you so much for your assistance - effective and efficient!  #DiscoveryDidGood ref number **********",5
"So I’m only to be allocated 25points/day for good driving yet penalised 79, 61 and 66 points for 3 consecutive days now because Discovery has the incorrect speed limits (I suspect that this is purposefully done) when even the road traffic act says differently. If you’re a Discovery Insure client best you check your daily drive points because it seems they are hell bent on ruining holidays and minimising fuel cash backs. And try to use the app to get hold of them? Don’t bother. It hasn’t worked for two years now.",1
"I am very dissappointed with the after sale service or lack thereof from a sales agent who assured me during the call that i could email him at anytime should i need further assistance. He has gone AWOL since the last time he concluded the sale,he is NOT replying my emails. Shame on you Nolinn!!!

Firstly, he has captured one of my vehicles on the cover as its without a tracker meanwhile it has an early response tracker and a panic button. Ive tried to reach out to him to rectify that before the pro rata was debited as i understand that would affect my premium but that was obviously not done as he is unreacheable.

This morning the pro rata was debited as well as another separate amount of R150 which i wonder?*** is it for???

I need someone to please rectify the tracker thing on my policy as ive sent through tracker installation certificates for the vehicles. Also some need to explain what that R150 was debited for???!!

At this point i wanna crawl back to Miway because im not even sure why i chose to try Discovery insure that is only interested in debiting my bank account but no proper after sale service when i need it🙄",1
Shafick Allow from Retentions helped me remove my car from my policy quickly and seamlessly on just minutes after I'd sold it. A pleasant service experience.,5
"On the 28th of December I called Discovery and required roadside assistance. My call was answered by Willie, I told him I need to be jumpstarted, he took my details and promised to call me back in 15 minutes . He did call back after 10 minutes or so and advised that a supplier will be with me in 30 minutes. The tow guy arrived in less than 10 minutes after my call with Willie and assisted me with my car. I was very impressed with Willie and how quick he was to resolve my issue. Thank you Willie and keep up the great work!!!",5
"So disgusted with your insurance department. I asked for a quote on a new car, in comparison to other quotes and I was told ""sorry mam, this is all we can offer"" - there were no attempts at negotiating. I will move my car, and home insurance currently insured by you elsewhere. Thanks for the pathetic customer service and efforts to keep current customers.",1
"About 8 months ago I was contacted by Discovery insure’s broker, was advised that I would get 50% cash back of my monthly premiums on the 6th month wether I would’ve claimed or not.

7 months later I have not received anything, whenever I call Discovery I get transferred to their broker since they were the ones I spoke to. S-crow promised to retrieve our conversation and assist accordingly, a full month later there’s still no response from from Discovery and it’s broker.

Whenever I call back I am advised that  they are yet to listen to our conversation and revert back me,I guess our initial conversation that was less than 20 minutes takes a full month to get listened to.

If such things take this long to be attended to ,what would happen when we need to be covered in a case of an accident?.",1
"Thank you to Basetsana Makgoro from the Servicing Department. Friendly, professional, and additions were done immediately.",5
"Shafick Allow the best consultant award goes to this man. His way of explaining and making me understand has top my expectations. He is such a very patient, understanding and considerate. His way of making the client understand different types of products and how it works blown me away. I am so appreciative as he made sure that I hang up that call with a smile.",5
"I have requested for them to debit a week ago and still waiting, what happens if I’m an accident?
Please this matter seriously.

😞",2
"This Insurence company is a mediocre, lack of transparency and honesty. Upon affiliation with them on Insurence, you are promised things to which they themselves are unable to comprehend and deliver to their customers. Turnaround times very poor….something that should take two days takes about almost week if not more. I am planning on getting a better value for money elsewhere because clearly discovery insure still need to discover themselves.",1
"I wish to give a review for Mr Riaan Whitney. After sending my claim on October 27, 2021 and not hearing from Discovery Insure in-spite  of all the promises, Riaan Whitney was allocated my two claims on 21 December 2021. Like a breath of fresh air, Riaan was able to conclude my claims in 3 days. He gave me feedback every step of the way and I had my two claims settled in a satisfactory way just before Christmas. What a wonderful gift and what a wonderful person to work with?  He has restored my faith at a time when I was about to change from Discovery to something else because of previous poor service and declining my genuine problems at both my properties. Riaan is a true Ambassador of Discovery Insure. If everyone at Discovery insure paid such attention to their work, Discovery insure would grow in leaps and bounds. I hope Riaan is awarded and recognised accordingly by the employer. Tselane Mokuena",5
"Did business with an assessor, Riaan Whitney, this week and he is just one of those people that restores your faith in human kind again. Thanks Discovery. Your service is just top notch.",5
"A really quick & efficient interaction via the Live Chat functionality online. Mzwakhe Maduna assisted me, and he was really helpful.

"i am a discovery insure member and i reversed into anothers car.
They have been appalling to say the very least.
They were slow to check the car, they were poor with their communication if at all. .None of use ever knew what was happening, and finally the last straw is that they have left this payment a week later than they should have so the poor person is still without car because he cant pay to get his car back until discovery insure pays him. There is no sense of urgency AND this is not the service i have come to expect from discovery.

I am embarrassed that i have put the poor gentleman through all of this.
Discovery Insure have  a very long way to go.

Im sure you too will be disappointed in there overall service and performance.
I never claimed so was unaffected by this but i feel his pain, it has truly been unbearable..

This is the second claim and both have been appallingly serviced..

Best Regards
Lance Moor",1
I put in a claim 2days back and I have not received any response or assistance from them. I called in 2day to check what's heppening and I was made to hold the line for over 3omin untill the phone hung up. My last claim was also a mess.,1
"I submitted a claim with Discovery months ago. They were late in arranging my car hire & they are yet to compensate with an Uber voucher. The panel beater they allocated used up all my petrol, who knows where they were driving my car to, it needed body work. Even after sending tons of emails, they ignore me.",1
"Good day I had a break in on 10 December 2021.

The broke the burglar bar to gain entry to my house.
 I called on 11/ December after I obtained case number ad block  phones.
I then started my emails, on what was requested from me.
my first email was on 13 December 15h04 with my list ... proof and quotations.
on 15th December I had to resent my emails, due to no response from the claims handler . I resend all my mails again to a new claims handler who told me that the claims handler is on leave.
On 17th I mailed for an update ... no response.
then I received an sms informing me that my claim has been re-allocated to a new claims handler .
I called and was requested to sen some information again, the lady said they did not received all emails.... yet it went threw from my side.

I called again 20th December just to be informed  the claims handler is busy and will get back to me soon.

I emailed and asked for a written update in my claim,,,, no response..
Today 22 I called again asked for an update... just to be informed they did not received all my emails.

so I resend the mails and proof requested.  
 I counted I had send so far in total 36 emails......... keep resending information and proof..... really...

I seriously have my doubts about my insurance..... 
I spoke to my daughter who also is with Discovery... she is rethinking her insurance with discovery.

How can a person be treated like this....  when you had a break in ... your privacy has been violated, your house has been left a mess by the culprits..

And I must keep on phoning and emailing for action on this.....

The incident happened on the 10th December . 
I reported to my Insurance all on 11 December, and started sending the proof emails.

Yet today is 22nd 11 days later and im still like a chicken with no head.

is this how me the victim getting treated by my insurance ......

I am very disappointed in this kind off treatment really",1

"Dear Discovery,
 Thank you so much for ruining my festive shopping (i.e blocking my Vitality Active gear benefits) when you activated my drive on the Discovery Health App.
Here are the things I missed out:
1. Miles D-Day
2. Generating a wiCode for my Nike gear and Active gear so I can purchase things for my kids.

I took out Insure on the 14th Dec and wanted to be effective on the 25 January and Lord behold the genius behind your systems decided to activate thr stupid drive reward on my Health App and now it blocked EVERYTHING...i mean EVERYTHING because it wants to connect the DQ tracker to my phone and the car. How the hell would you do that? Did I deserve all that? I lost money because I could not use my discounts. 
Then I decide to cancel the stupid policy. Guess what? The stupid thing is still not being disabled on my Health App.

Oh I called Vitality, they sent me to digital...guess what digital sent me to Vitality then Vitality sent me to Insure and Insure said they disabled it and it should disappear within 24-36 hours. LIES!!! I bet you first sentence would be "" Apologies..."" will it bring back what I have lost? NO, IT WONT.",1
Thanks to Shafick Allow from Retentions Department. He helped me seamlessly and was very patient with me. Thank you very much for your understanding and being so helpful. They should give you a festive bonus because I'm sure I'm not the only client that's happy because of him.,5

"Discovery is refusing to communicate about lost fuel rewards. About two months ago I made them aware, after multiple attempts at communicating, that my Dq track wasn’t functioning correctly. I am one of those drivers who try to make full use of the Discovery Rewards programs and max out my fuel rewards by driving extremely cautiously yet because of the lack of urgency of dealing with the issue, I lost out on about R800 worth of fuel rewards. Besides the fact that the vehicle had stood still for nearly two weeks of this period, Discivery have made no attempt to rectify the situation. It’s the same with every single one of their rewards programs. If it’s not working properly then ***** the clients rewards. If you’re not up to constantly checking whether they’re ‘rewarding you’ for jumping through the countless hoops, just find another provider who charges less or who actually listens.",1
I was serviced by Thuto mokgosi. And she made me realised why i am hooked to the service from discovery. Thank you very much.,5
"I logged claim with discovery insure on 27 November, the Claims consultant Palesa Kekana emailed to say that an asSessor was assigned on 29 November. Since then she failed to communicate with us regarding the claim. she also did not respond to numerous emails sent to her.  I even called the call centre twice, and on the first occasion I asked the consultant to contact the service provider, on speaking to them I found out that they had incorrectly put a note on my claim to say that it was already assessed, had the discovery claims consultant did her job she would have found this out, yet she didnt.  between myself and my broker company we have contacted Disovery insure regarding this claim  today I was contacted by a company called Thesl to say that Discovery has authorised my claim for a takealot voucher.  Palesa did not contact us once regarding finalising the claim, when I refused the voucher, Palesa contacted me because I had complained to Discovery insure via Messenger. She told me that she finalised the claim directly with my broker as she couldn't get hold of my husband(my husband or myself never received a single call from Palesa) , I asked for proof of that call and she wasn't able to provide me with proof, neither did she communicate to my husband via email or sms that she had tried contacting him regarding finalising the claim.  It took Discovery insure 25 days to finalise a claim for a portable device. this is unacceptable.  It seems that Discovery insure Customer relations needs some attention, or discovery insure needs to get more staff to handle claims,as it seems that the claims consultant had too much on her plate to take time to even respond to customers emails.",2
I received brilliant service from Thabo Mokoena on Sunday when I needed help to start my vehicle. He called to check if the service provider had contacted me and called me after to ensure that I received the assistance. Very impressed with his professionalism and care.,5
"Really poor service received on multiple occasions. 
I logged a claim 20 Novemeber for hail damage that blocked my gutters and flow off the roof resulting in the roof leaking and damaging my ceilings and floor. I have videos as well as picture of the damage actually occurring. It first took 2 weeks for them just to get someone to come and asses and give feedback. I was never kept up to date as to what is happening. Constantly had to email and every now and then I would get a reply.  Last week after almost a whole month i was called and told that the claim was rejected due to maintenance issues. When requested the  agent failed to give me details of exactly why its rejected. She then promised to send me the rejection letter immediately. Its been a week now i haven’t received the letter as a result i cant dispute the rejection and the year is coming to an end when everything is about to close. I emailed the agent multiple times since then and called her. Not surprisingly she refuses to answer my emails or answer calls. She chose to just clearly ignore me. 
Name of this agent is Silindile. 
Thats not all i logged a claim in October for lightening damage to my alarm system. Its now almost emd of december and i am still without an alarm system even tho the claim was approved. They keep having excuse of wrong parts or oarts not being available or assessor didnt asses the damage correctly and now we need more stuff. Its just a big mess. For being such a big company and providing such   Poor level of service its not even pathetic it’s disheartening that they can be so unprofessional especially when they also provide health insurance. I really regret taking discovery insure. I would never in a 100 years recommend them to anyone. I am actually going to terminate my insurance with them",1
"i was debited by discovery insure two weeks after i told them i am not interested in having insurance with them.

cancelling what they wrongfully setup was a night mare an getting the reversal of my money is a continues nightmare",1
It is virtually impossible to submit a claim on Discovery APP or website. The call center is not available to assist either. I can only wonder how I will eventually submit the claim.,1
"I locked a claim on the 28 November 2021, the assessor collected the TV in the 1st December 21  with my bracket, he promised to bri g it back the following day, but he never did  I called my insurance on the 17 December 21  to inform them that the assessor took my bracket and I was advised that they will instruct them to return it to date  I have done numerous calls with empty promises that they will call me back  I call discovery every day with my airtime I will hold for 30minutes without answer, I really need to know when would u bring back my bracket i can't wait any longer my claim number **********, I send Keneilwe Makgalemele an email nut she's not responding. I just spoke to Jabu now she tried to put me to claim dept.i got cut off..DISCOVERY YOUR SERVICE IS SO DISAPPOINTING, I bought a TV what must I do now",1
"Still waiting for proof of payment  from discovery on a vehicle that was written off. I cannot buy a other vehicle,and the bank is going to deduct a installment on a vehicle that I don't have any more. Discovery said they have made the payment on the 10th of December,it is now the 21nd?? MFC still has not received payment or proof of payment.",1
My car was written off and discovery insurance rejected the whole claim saying the back tires contributed on the accident. The worse part of it is that. The person who was assigned for the claim (claims consultant)  never updated me during the process. I now think this person never existed. Noluvo Raleie.,1
My car wouldn't start this morning. I used the emergency call back option and Aretha promptly called me back and organised AA to come jump start my car. She also followed up after the assistance to check if all is well. Thank you Aretha for the great service 😉,5
I am very thankful to have people like Shafick Allow from Discovery Insure - Retentions department assisting me with discounts for our clients and the ease of service he provides.,5
"PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE DON'T EVER INSURE WITH DISCOVERY INSURE 

I HAVE NEVER BEEN SO ILL TREATED I MY ENTIRE LIFE. 

After capturing the wrong information my claim was rejected. 

Pretoria north had a massive storm the afternoon of the 5th of November. Discovery insure even warned me with an SMS about the storm. 

My parents in law and their neighbors also sustained damages to their property caused by extremely strong winds. 

My legally blind wife who was home at the time informed me of the roof leaking the night of the 5th of November. Me being away from home on a work trip I only got home the night of the 12th of November. 
I tried to phone the claim department of discovery insure that next morning being the 13th of November. With the claims department not being available I was forced to phone again the morning of the 15th of November. 

After I logged the claim they told me that the assessor will make contact with me that same day. Witch was not the case. The assessor assigned only on the morning of the 18th of November phone me to arrange the assessment. 
He reported due to lack of maintenance the roof got damaged. Before the storm I didn't have any problems with the roof of my house. 

On the 23rd of November I received an email saying that my claim has been partially repudiated. 

Call after call I tried to get through to Jacqueline Naidoo to explain exactly what happened. After the 7th time of me trying to be put through to her I insisted on her managers details. 

Thuso mafumo the head of the claims department made contact with me. After she had a look at the claim she still rejected it. 

I think it's because of me joining discovery insure about 4 months ago. But in saying that I was with Outsurance for nearly 10 years with one claim. 

Please advise",1
"Renew it Panel beaters is your preferred service provider, maybe you need to reconsider who you have on your books, as the quality of repairs done to my vehicle we absolutely disgusting",1
"The Discovery Travel department is shocking. No response via email nor phone. Giving excuses for travel restrictions is NOT an excuse to abandon your loyal customer base. I am shocked by the experience. If you know there is higher demand, put more people in place. Instead you sit on money paid without delivering service.",1
"Discovery Insure has really slipped up on their costomer experience. After doing an online claim, I waited a couple of days before receiving an sms informing me to go to a specific assessor, who sis not know about me and some other persons details, but he still did the assessment and sent it to discovery. Then a day or two later I was asked to submit photos, which I did when I lodged the claim online and then the assessor took plenty of photos too, after telling the consultant this, she seemed the confirm the photos were submitted. Then nothing, I have been waiting for weeks for some confirmation/outcome for whatever, but nothing forthcoming, and then I try calling them and wait for 30 mins for one of their so called 'skilled consultants'to answer, which never happens and I gave up... they are rubbish, and I am now seeking an alternative insurance company!!! Dicosvery you have lost yet another customer!!!",1
Thank you Tasmina Nair for perfect and quick service and assistance.,5
"Good Day,

Poor service when attempting to log a claim via telephone. Called twice and waited 10mins on average, then I got cut off, 1st time the agent answered and then cut me off, the second time I got cut off after 11mins.",1
"I just wanted to give some much deserved praise to Riaan Whitney and I need to add by choosing Discovery Insure their claim experience will put a smile on your face, they take something that would otherwise be tedious and turn it into a great customer experience,  thank you Discovery and Riaan.",5
My car broke down in the middle of the road on a Sunday morning. Discovery Insure were able to arrange a tow truck which arrived in 30mins. Very impressed with the efficient service when it comes to break down emergencies.,5
"Discovery have changed the speed limit in our suburb to 20km/h. WHO drives 20km/h in a suburb? It was changed approx Aug and nearly IMPOSSIBLE to change the speed to 60km/h. There are NO, but NO speed limit signs in most South African suburbs but yet every single time I query it....Discovery asks me for a PHOTO of a speed limit sign with the ""correct"" speed limit?! Really? This error is causing us to loose a lot of rewards and cash-back etc. Surely Discovery can contact the Road agency to check and change. Streets in Randpark, JHB.",2
tasmina nair was quick and efficient.,5
"Discovery service is very shocking and poor.

My car was in a accident on friday , 15th November.
It took discovery a whole week to review if my claim was valid and only got the go ahead on 22nd November, .

From there it all went downhill. I had to phone continuously for feedback on my car, my whole Christmas is ruined and my car is still not fixed. Till date no one has phoned me and repairer will be closed for the Christmas periods which means I will have not a car until who knows when.

For those who read this review, please think when insuring with discovery as they are quick to take your money, but provide a good service is something they can’t do

Disgusted overall at the way they are handling this claim and their employees  are very rude on the phone, from their assessors to their call agents.",1
Rude behaviour from consultant. Might look for other insurance. @ Mrs Caromba,1
Tried to log a call at 5:50. Cut off 3 times by the operator and finally at 6pm went through to emergency line as the claims office is closed after 6pm. Can't log a claim after 6pm!! So you get cut off several times so that no consultant needs to work after 6pm.,1
"I had made an appointment with Discovery Insurance for them to install the tracking unit for my car at 13.00 this Friday afternoon the 17th December, at the time of writing, 16.22 nobody has bothered to phone or arrive for the appointment. After 5 calls to various people this problem has not been resolved. I have wasted my whole day with this",1
"Just cancelled my Vehicle Insurance Policy.  Thanks to Mathibedi Chueu for making this a painless experience.  

Efficient, courteous, helpful and friendly service.  

Thank you Mathibedi.",5
"Discovery Insure are truly pathetic I have had two major incidences with them they are truly thieves

in 2019 whilst being a client with Discovery insure one of the insure vehicles was in an accident the cause of a 3rd party that was previously a client of Discovery Insure however after months fighting with them they were never able to get in touch with the 3rd party forcing us to resign from them, now I was in accident a direct cause of one of their clients I have lodged a 3rd party claim, their client has accepted liability but they are only willing to settle 70% of the claim as there is a possibility in there minds that the accident could of been avoided now they want to throw around legal **** ,this is unacceptable and I will be going viral with this",1
Always get the excellent service,5
"Kelebogile (Lebo) Diale took my call when I was stranded on the M2 West, and immediately assured me that she'll get in touch with the service provider to come and tow my car. She communicated the driver's name, and some 45 minutes when we were on the road after receiving assistance, she called again to find out if help had arrived. It was great experiencing the follow-up and professional care! Kudos!",5
"A big thanks to Ntswaki Shabangu, she's awesome",5

"Had a burst geyser and reported it(happened on a public holiday).  I received excellent service from Moloko Mathabathe.  The plumber was at my door within an hour and the claim submitted an hour later.  Thus far, I am very pleased with their service.",5
"My vehicle claim was approved over 2 months ago, yet I still do not have the vehicle. On 26 November 2021 the panel beater confirmed 95% completion status with my insure and raised the factor that my vehicle doesn’t start. Only on 14 December 2021 Netasses responded with information that my vehicle doesn’t start because of engine being damaged. Yet, the investigator assigned to my case went to review the vehicle and confirmed that the ignition does start but the but the motor may be faulty. 

Discovery hasn’t came to a conclusion 2 months later on what the status of the vehicle will be. After numerous calls to their call center, i still don’t have confirmation from discovery on way forward. I am shocked to know that my car doesn’t start whereas on collection and the investigator confirmed that the vehicle does start.",1

Spoke to Matibedi at discovery insure who was very polite and helpful thank you,5
"I cancelled my Car & Contents Insurance with effect 31.10.21, yet Discovery still took off the premium for November although they had been notified of cancellation. The DQ tracker has been removed. 
I have made numerous phone calls (none of which are free phone calls, and each of which lasts no less than 20 minutes - mainly being on hold), and been advised by numerous consultants that the payment was being processed - they could see it was on the system - yet here I am waiting, after yet another empty promise yesterday morning that I would receive a call by close of business re: refund.
I Called again today to follow up and request the staff member in Client Servicing Department by name - his colleague said he was sitting next to him and had passed the message on - I was once again informed it was with the ever elusive Accounts department. I asked him to ensure he phoned back by latest 11:45, it is now after 12:00. 
It is now 15.12.21. All of my calls and my numerous mails going back to Mid October are on record, and I have reached the end of my tether.
It is near impossible to contact Discovery via e-mail - they merely send automated responses - and all of my telephone calls have ended in empty promises and NO refund. 
Discovery appear to be very quick in adding items to your Policy Schedule, yet make it almost impossible to cancel, and/or receive a refund - and after a brief look online - it appears that this is a recurring theme. Not exactly an advert for trust.",1
"Thanks to Discovery Insure for the excellent product and for the delightful service I received from Moloko Mathabathe. When my car keys were accidentally locked inside the car, she managed to find me a competent locksmith to open my car and gave the experience that I thought I would never have. I appreciate the support and the constant reassurance I received from you on this day.",5
"I want to express my gratitude to MATHIBEDI CHUEU for helping me professionally. He evaluated my circumstance and managed to offer me a more affordable product.

Thankyou MATHIBEDI CHUEU",5
I am an extremely disappointed client of Discovery Insure.  My claim number is **********. It is now almost a month and my claim for my cellphone is still outstanding. I spoke to a number of consultants who promised to get back to me but didn't.  My last call yesterday to Martome and he confirmed that he will get back to me by cob yesterday but I'm still awaiting feedback. My contact number is **********. Regards Vincent Chetty,1

"Joash Govender has been extremely helpful, efficient and professional so far with our claim and having it resolved as soon as possible.",5
"We all know how frustrating it can be to phone an insurance provider and stay on hold forever while the consultant tries to solve your problem.

"I lodged a claim on 2 December 2021, got an email from Palesa Kekana 3rd December 2021, she would be in contact shortly.

I asked to speak to Ms Kekana's team leader, got no call back from her and received her email address, ***********, got no response on the second email I sent I got a reply she is out of the office to contact *********** or ***********.

FRUSTRATION IS NOT EVEN THE WORD ANYMORE.",1
"Pathetic service... LIES, THEFT and NO Customer service.

Made amendments to my policy, was on diamond status for many years, now they drop me to gold and refuse to correct.

This affected all my rewards including cash backs, they have been saying for months they will refund me, however have not. They also lie about the discounts, on diamond status I only got the discount on the service fee and not invoice fee as advertised.

They promised to compensate me for the 100 phone calls I have had to make from October to date, and nothing. They are liars and never keep to their word.

I cant imagine the trouble one would go through for claims.
Been trying to make amendments to my policy since yesterday. No one returns calls, no ownership taken. THE SERVICE at Discovery is PATHETIC. Don't be fooled by what they offer.",1
"Was sold insure many, many years ago - promised the world and the worst service when it came to claim
Promised ""blanket cover""
Promised all valuation certificates and proof of ownership added to a Discovery vault
I claimed for a watch, wallet, glasses and a few other things in a women handbag
Was told ""so sorry"" broker didn't add any blanket cover so only the nominated watch will be paid. Then was told the broker forgot to put anything into vault so I had to prove by photos and go to TAG for quotes. Again they blame ""broker"" but I took the policy from Discovery direct. at the time DSI then names discovery connect they the department in the discovery head office.
So my claim was R35k+ and told ill get R18K minus the excess 
They pride themselves on being able to do the claims online I did and never processed 
I called and submitted the claim manually with Discovery a couple of days later
Discovery sent me a ref number and a consultants email address via text only to find out wrong email address they have on their system Jane legodi so Jane was uncontactable via call centre and email
Got hold of a new consultant names Aurellia she told me they were going to their suppliers to get valuations again waisted my time upfront putting in vault and then going back to TAG this delayed process 
Aurellia Ngcobo  sent me the AOL to complete which I signed and sent back 
No word further so I finally got hold of Aurellia team leader Unica Van Leeuwen who said she will take ownership of this and process the claim finally even not the amount I was always assured cover but the R18K 
Was told daily the money will be paid 
5 days later after constantly being told it will be paid I was told that both Aurellia and Unica never completed the process of sending the completed AOL to the relevant department. This was now two weeks later and a Friday so was told  they will finally proceed and payment made Saturday. 
no payment on the Saturday so called discovery on the recording the broker Abigail was the only honest one and said the claim was submitted Friday very late only (2 weeks later) she said payment will be made Monday
I was then give Unicas managers email address and told she might help - when I emailed her it said she was out of office later to hear she had covid 
Unicas manager Yasmin Khan did call me and apploigized and assured me my claim was about to be paid. while speaking to her Jane finally 3 weeks later emailed me saying it will be paid in 72 hours. I was like who now do I believe. Yasmin assured me all finally sorted. well NO payment yesterday no payment today and out of all the people involved no one answer an email or calling me back. 
I was lied to about all the fancy cover and processes insure have to offer then we excepted I was sold half what was promised and settled for a tiny payout Im still fighting to get my money out of insure. 
I wish I had not been with Insure for out and about cover for the past 6 years when it finally came to claim unless you willing to go to the ombudsman you probably will be like me 46 emails and 16 - 30 minute phone calls and still no claim paid. 
shocking and disappointing 
great product but unless you have a good independent broker to fight for you I would def recommend you do not go direct to Discovery insure. When you call they will inform you they on teams and can only chat to their manager or other staff via text and nothing gets done and clearly no management - waisted so many years of premiums thinking Im covered but Im not. Discovery blame the ""Broker"" but the broker still works for Discovery.",1

"Good day, My car lost power and stalled on the R21 yesterday 13/12/21. I was able to get to the emergency lane safely. The trucks would drive very fast so much so that my car would shake every time a truck would whizz pass. I phoned Discovery and ended up speaking to Joelene Scholtz from the Emergency Services department. After she did the normal security checks she immediately sensed that I was in a nervous state. She dealt with me with so much compassion and explained the process that will follow. Whilst she was arranging for a tow truck, she continuously phoned me to check up on me. I got home safely and would like to thank Joelene for the personnel service that I've received from her and Discovery as a whole for doing what they promised. The reference for the incident is **********",5
I received a great and impeccable  service from Discovery Insure- Mpumelelo Khoza.They connected me with the Service Provider- Mukolola Road Assistance timeously. Keep up the good work,5
I recieved the best service ever from Wanda Mdunyelwa and Sibukeli Kolondiya. In the past week I had car issues twice and on the 2 occasions I was helped first by Wanda and secondly by  Sbu. They both went beyond my expectations in assisting me on the roadside when my car broke down in an unsafe location. They made sure the tow truck arrived as soon as possible and constantly called me to make sure I was safe and even when I got home they followed up to check that I was home safely. Thank you so much to both gentlemen for making me feel safe and taking care of business. They are both such gems.,5
"I'm very unhappy with this insurance and very frustrated, I have been your customer for more than 5 years but you treat me like I haven't been paying premiums religiously. I canceled one of my cars with you and you still deducted my money at the end of the month. when I call in to query I get no assistance. I want my money its been more that 15days  and there is still no refund in my bank account. I'm very unhappy with you incompetence and the lack of urgency.",1

I replied immediately stating that this was not the case, and claim should be processed urgently. I did not get any feedback until I contacted the Discovery Insure Call centre on 09/12/21. The claim was then authorised and Glasfit was appointed to replace the windscreen. It still has not been replaced and the vehicle can not be driven in current state. No feedback from Discovery Insure.",1

"Horrific service from Discovery Insurance, 3 men robbed me in my home a week ago. I registered the claim for 10 items on the same day. Since then, besides constant calling, emails, and my broker's involvement too, no one has helped me. As if the trauma of being robbed in one's home is not bad enough, then one has to deal with the trauma of not even being able to even get through to Discovery on the phone. Absolutely shocking. I used to be with Outsurance and the experience when claiming is like chalk and cheese. Discovery your insurance claiming process is traumatising for people who have already been traumatised!!!!",1
They want to increase my Premium with 15%  without any explanation or valid reason just a general comment that the car has depreciate but spares has increased. I do expect a increase  but  not at 15% i would think more around 5 to 6% . They basically increased each section with +_ 15% after i complained the lady look at my Credits and reduced the premium to +_ 12% what a joke,1
Why does CLEARSCORE reflect negative with a amount of R1290 showing I owe money to Discovery Insurance? For months I have been mailing Clearscore and everytime they promise it will be rectified the following month.. and still Discovery shows amount owing is R1290??,1
"Discovery Insurance is by far the worst insurance provider, I have been trying too contact them about mu claim and they are just giving me the run around, but when they want their money no one is giving them the run around. This is one insurance company I would NEVER EVER!!!!!!!!  recommend too anyone. They say u can claim on their app but then you must still phone after them and when you get hold of them u must start the process all over again.",1

"I was quoted R1971.58 on the 09.12.21 for my BMW X1 28i xdrive 2013, when the supervisor called to confirm the information I was then informed the information was captured incorrectly as BMW X1 20i xdrive 2013 when the information was rectified the amount went up to R2300  which I declined as it was too high. Few minutes later on the same day I was called and advised that they we able to the premiums to R1990 which I still considered too high because it was not the initial amount that was sold to me from the begging and the consultant was even able to tell me it wasn’t too much of a difference to the initial premium and it shouldn’t be too much from my pocket considering that I wasn’t going to pay any access when I claim and I’ll be getting cash back.
When I check on the app today 10.12.21 the information was still incorrect the year model was captured incorrect still, when I called back to rectify  this the premium went over R2000 which was still unfair as this was not my mistake since I’ve given them the correct details from the onset I really find this unprofessional for a company like discovery, I have cancelled my previous insurance believing I’m moving over to a better company but it has been only 2 days with so many mistakes. I believe the premiums could be adjust based on the fact that it was not initially my fault that the information was captured incorrectly, if I had not checked the information on the app I would encounter problems when it’s time for me to claim and it wasn’t going to be considered that the fault wasn’t mine, I need the premiums to be revised.",1
Thank you to Joelene Scholtz at Discovery Insure for your excellent service. Joelene was quick to assist with the car accident and was always ready to assist with any queries! Thank you Joelene,5
"I am actually lost for words with the service we have received from Discovery Insurance ☹️
We were involved in an horrific car accident in September 2021. Our vehicle was taken by our insurance to a VW approved auto body shop. We were then told by the repairer mid November that the seat cover and roof stitching would only arrive late Jan 2022 in order for us to get our vehicle back in February soonest. The first communication received about this part was only firstly 6 weeks after the accident (heaven knows why this took so long for them to realize they need this part after all 6 airbags were deployed in the accident) & that we are expected to arrange alternative transport at our own cost for over 5 months after an accident?? 

I have spend hours on the phone trying to get answers from both VW as well as Discovery as to how this is acceptable or to expedite the matter, only to be told its out of their control. Why do we pay thousands per month to be insured so that in times of crisis we have less stress? Discovery Insure have just passed the blame to VWSA but Volkswagen say our insurance should cover these unusual circumstances. Yes! We all know that there is a shortage of containers worldwide & that supply and demand on imported goods is tough but this is not an unusual part needed but they surely have protocol and assistance in place for these circumstances?

I am still expected to pay over R12000 each month for my car insurance and vehicle finance while I don't have the car & then to pay over R7000 per month to rent a vehicle so that I can maintain my job. ☹️

I cannot believe that after having all policies with Discovery for over 12 years that this is the service provided ☹️☹️☹️",1
"Every encounter with Prince Sibiya from Discovery Broker Services is nothing short of Greatness. Thank you, Prince.",5

"I am a new client to Discovery Insure. When the initial sale was made I was treated like royalty but it would seem like that is where it stopped. From the time that we initialized the insurance to the inception of the insurance we move house. We moved to 
1 a lower risk area
2 house with many better security features than my previous home.

So great was my surprise when my premium went up with nearly R300 from the initial quoted premium. When I asked them why this is no-one could give me a answer. On the 24th of November 2021 I phoned them again to cancel this policy as I wanted to go back to OUTsurance whom then gave me a premium even lower than that of Discovery Insure. Bob, who helped me promised some-one will phone me back within 2 days. It is now the 10 December 2021, 16 day later and I am still waiting. on 9 December I phoned again asking some-one to phone back. I am still waiting. It would seem than Discovery Insure is only interested to get new clients yet not interested in answering the difficult questions. Now I have to wonder, how are they going to treat me when I claim. Discovery Insure, You disappoint me",1

I have reported that our alarm system was struck by lightning on 29 September 2021.

I urgently need my alarm repaired!",2
"The Policyholder Protection Rules require an insurer to make it easy to claim and not to impose unreasonable barriers to claimants. I think that Discovery falls short of this legislative requirement

On Monday my house was damaged in a fire, a very traumatic event for me children and my mother, who is 80.I contacted Discovery to submit a claim on Monday evening.  I have been informed via an automated sms that my claim has been reassigned three times yet no-one has contacted me to actually start the evaluation of the damage or tell me the steps.

On 11 Nov I sent them my information to update my profile from passport to ID. I hear nothing back for weeks. I call 2 Dec and a nice lady says the merge has been done centrally and she will update it on Insure side and it should take 12 hours and she will call me back the next day. She never calls back. I call today 9 Dec to follow up and query what’s happening with my vitality drive - which apparently had been fixed after a YEAR of recording trips but not syncing to their site (rant for another time) and find out that apparently my profile was merged but the ID number they quote me is 12 digits. You want to tell me that your systems aren’t even programmed to pick up that an ID field has 12 digits???!!! This is just too much.,1
"I called Discovery Insure this afternoon to a product on my policy. I got attended to by Thabiso Mahlangu and I got my than a service. We spoke about a wide variety of products offered by Discovery and how clients can take advantage of these. Thanks for the great service Thabiso, keep it up!!",5
"It has taken Discovery insure 11 days aand repeated emails to respond to a simple claim of damaged good.  It was seen by an assesor (Martin) who was excellent and followed up almost immediately he was involved in the process, even when he was not responsible.
The claims people, Nqobile and Cleopatra, were worse than useless, not communication or responding, and then offered a settlement below what was quoted for.  Full email strings available.
Really bad service from Discovery
Then to top it all, they copy two other people I know on the final incorrect  settlement.  They have nothing to do with the claim and this is an invasion of both my and their privacy.  Shocking. Sloppy. Unprofessional.",1

"#DiscoveryDidGood Emercency Service

Words can't express how great full I am for Discovery Insure and Moses Malinga.

I just sat down, busy logging into my PC at work when i got a call from Discovery insure. A call that could define what was promise to me when i join the discovery over a year ago.

To be honest i got more then what i expected from Discovery.

Moses explain to me my wife car impact sensor went off and that her vehicle was stationary in the middle of the road and he tried phoning her and she is not responding to his calls, my heart immediately shrink and i couldn't comprehend  what his was telling me because of the shock.

He tried his best to calm me down, and what i like i about this service he could exactly tell me where the accident happen. I told him I'm going to the scene and i will also try calling my wife, he told me in the meantime he will dispatch towing service to see what is going on at the scene that they can give us more information on the scene.

It was morning traffic and it took me sometime to get to the scene, but Moses didn't sit back he made his job to reassure me and kept phoning me for any updates.

Eventually  when i arrive at the scene i was just relief to see my wife was OK, just a little shaken up from shock. 

ER Towing service told me when i got at the scene Discovery informed them about the accident and they help my wife to take photos of the driver and vehicle that drove into my wife.

And basically i felt like a bystander because they had everything under control, in this chaotic morning for me.

Moses phone me back at explained what was going to happen, and he also offered trauma counselling for my wife, which i thought was just amazing.

He told me that we needed to go to the nearest police station to report the accident with in 24 hours, he took down the details of the driver that cause the accident and inform that he will log the claim on my behalf and the vehicle will be towed to Auction Nation where they will assess the car.

He also started the process of getting the courtesy car ready and with in 3 hours of the accident Avis phoned my wife and told her where she can come pick up the courtesy vehicle.

Once the claim was registered i received an sms with my claim number and person assign to my claim.

Peter who is assign to my claim phone the next day and explain the process of how the claims will work and it will take about 5 workings day to finalize the claim.

My wife and I are extremely impress with the service and myself especially knowing i can rest assure when my wife drivers alone that Discovery got our backs.

Excellent service so far i can't thanks Moses and Discovery enough, now we just waiting on the claim process to be completed.

But good job all around thank you guys.",5
"So on the 14th November 2021 there was a collision in a parking area against my car. Had no idea what happend but came out of the mall and saw my car has been damaged. I went immediately to the police station and reported it. Did a claim online and submitted it. I got contacted by Moipone Kgokolo and was asked a series of questions. Then I got contacted by Thapelo Magagula and asked again the same questions. On the 19th November 2021 I got contacted and was told my claim is authorized. On the 23rd November 2021 I got contacted again by Thapelo Magagula and was told that my claim hasn't been authorized after hearing it from 2 parties over the phone that it's authorized. Then they came up with an excuse to see who is the regular driver and got treated like a criminal. And all that went on and on. They couldn't establish a signal/map for the vitalty drive sensor. That sensor has been faulty all this time. I even told them that
I have a Huawei mate 40 pro that DOESN'T support Google play store. You need Google play store for the app to work and the vitalty drive sensor. The manager Cindy Postman then got involved, but they were still consistently treating me like a liar. Even got a message from her on WhatsApp stating/threating me with their legal dept. On 1 December 2021 I got a message to say that my claim had been authorized. I got all the proof. Then I got a phone call again saying it was sent 'by accident'. +-3weeks of this claim. My claim qaulfied for express repairs and they didn't even wanted to do that. It's like they made up their mind that they were not going to assist me with my claim before hand. I'm disappointed in discovery insure. And mostly their claims team. And I've kept my insurance up to date,but yet now I'll have to fix it out my pocket. This company made me look like a joke.",1
"BAD BAD BAD service.

I have no words for this experience, 1 has been calm and patient but it has come to this now.

Claim logged 8th November yet no resolution.

All they want is to sell my car in auction to the highest bidder.
Consultants are not providing feedback, 1 is constantly on the line been put on hold hours on hand or transferred pillar to post. When an email is received from their end its a one line same story ""awaiting on management""
Discovery claimed they cant source out a part 2 fix d car, dat it wil b 2 expensive 2 fix therefore they wana write off d car, mi d u thats based on the 1 qoute they got frm d assesor. I challed this within 24hrs of dat i provided dem with a 2nd qoute of genuine Nissan parts frm another reputable company also saving them over 20K frm the first qoute they sent me. Yet a month later im still left with no car nor any solution to them fixing my car, instead all im getting is silent treatment or a ""we will send u a release sheet for ur car frm our site"" Release it to wer if you havnt fixed nor paid me outso to go get it fixed???
Are these agents nd assesors working in cahoots to get 1s vehicle written off so dat they go sell it and mske money on their side???

@Discovery Insure fix my car or pay me out so that i go fix it as per all the email correspondence., stop messing me around.

How do you think i should get to work now? I have a smallchd in the house, what will i do should i hve an emergency God forbid, this is people's lives you are messing with.

"Initially the very best service received on my Claim with Discovery Insure, I was issued a Makro Voucher and went shopping. Exact Items could not be purchased as Discovery was quoted on replacement Brands by their service provider.
I then contacted Discovery and explained that the items claimed could not be replaced with the Makro Voucher. I agreed that Discovery cancel the voucher and approve the claim with their service provider. After approval; I contacted the service provided and asked why the items is a different brand than to what I had. Supplier had no stock and what was quoted was what was available at the time.
I asked about one specific item claimed that was not a complete system. Discovery Service provided said that they quoted for the receiver only and not a complete system.

This was my exact concern with the Makro Voucher.

The only issue is that this is not being resolved, numerous emails not answered. Calls have been made but was told today that no notes was made on the system.
so if there is no notes, there is no proof.

Discovery please help?",1

"A car breakdown is always the worst thing – it always happens with the worst possible timing. 

This was the case for me on the 06th December 2021 (Monday), when I had a break down along the N12, 46km out of Kimberley (Northern Cape). 
With a wailing toddler at the back, 500km from home, I was starting to get desperate when I called the Discovery Insure Emergency Services Department – to be connected to Zunaid Joseph. Now, this young professional just knows how to calm nervous parents/anxious drivers stuck on the roadside. With passing trucks and the crying toddler making our conversation difficult, he stayed cordial and patient throughout the call and he was very calming and kind to me. I think I even managed to crack a bad joke, at which he laughed. 

I am so impressed with the level of professionalism and the human touch that this young professional bestowed upon me and my 5-year-old toddler in our hour of desperation. What he did was above and beyond, no doubt – for that I commend this young fella. I got a service and more – and I am happy to have chosen Discovery Insure as my vehicle insurer of choice.",5

Discovery insure....... where do I even begin...claim logged on 27th November keeps changing accessors with no outcome or communication to us. You guys failed the 72 hr SLA what's the point having one.,1
Worse insurance ever!!! I had logged a claim on 15 october and ot is now 7 december. And my alarm system is still awaiting replacement after being approved! My life and my property has been at risk on the expense of discovery poor service. Furthermore they dont provide you with the contact number of the person dealing with your claim. They will give you their call centre number. Where you have to hold for hours until someone asmswers after being referred from person to person. And regrettably the call agent is usually of no help! Also they will not respond to your emails! Ot is really a mission to contact someone to help.  As soon as i can i will be cancelling my insurance with discovery!,1
"I had my car stolen nearly weeks ago. Discovery never come back to you. Different stories come up every time. Call the call center put on hold for 20 min before I gave up.

I have submitted a claim yesterday before 7am on Discovery app due to a storm crisis we had Saturday (when I phoned Saturday evening - there was no help) stick it out and call in office hours.

"I am so disappointed with Discovery Insure brokers Cdynamix. I have been trying to cancel my insurance policy but I have been given the run around for almost 3 weeks now. At first I was advised by the Client Care Advisor, Nkosana that I should not cancel with them because they would try to get me a revised quote for my insurance. I asked Nkosana to get back to me before the COB but instead I was ignored until I followed up the following day and Nkosana's supervisor, Sudesh contacted me saying the same thing. I have been requesting from the 22nd of November 2021 to cancel my policy but still nothing has been done up til now. 
I do not see the need as to why there needs to be delay tactics when a customer wants to cancel their insurance.",1

"After spending 3 weeks with Discovery (Vitality) to prove to them they have a faulty mobile application which was eventually admitted and fixed, I see the Insure app/sensor combination leaves much to be desired too.

I emailed a complaint about this last week and to date I have received no response to that, and as with the other mobile application I went to a lot of trouble explaining the issue, when it occurs, that it occurs with a number of people with different vehicles and mobile devices where the only common denominator is the sensor and the application.

As a new Insure client I am not impressed at all with the lack of response and customer care.",1
"I would like to commend Pablo Sedumedi from Discovery Insure for her exceptional service. She is very quick to action requests and is extremely competent. Discovery needs more people like her to deliver exceptional service.

When my policy commenced I had to call discovery to get my schedule 3 times last week and all consultants said one thing we will send it, we have sent it but nothing came through.

"I have a motor vehicle claim that has been open since September. The claim was initially approved but with a shortfall of R7k because Discovery did not believe the quotation I sent (even though it’s from the only official JLR dealership in the area). Further damage was discovered on the vehicle which was a result of the same accident, which has added another R50k to the repair costs. I am now out of pocket for R53k plus the R3k excess and they are just ignoring me. Every time I call, I get promised a call back, which never happens.",2
"I placed a claim for my Boundary wall that collapsed due to all the heavy rain the past 2 weeks.

A certain Mr Grayson-Lee Pillay was the assesor. He claimed that my wall wasn't built to building regulations. I explained to him that he wall was there since i moved in and only collapsed 5 years after moving in. He then said i must deal with it because nothing lasts forever! I think it is very unprofessional. Isn't that the reason we have insurance for because nothing lasts forever. And to top that he bend my gutters of my house during inspection and now i must fix it? Is this how Discovery works. If so im stopping my insurance and will go with someone else",1

Swift and friendly service Tasmina Nair!,5
I had a claim under the warranty section of my policy. Our Jeep broke down 26 November and Discovery towed us to a repair facility. I spoke to a chap called Kagiso who asked for a whole range of documents and information for the claim. This was sent on the 30 November for processing. Every day since then I have mailed and left messages for him to contact me to finalise the claim as I have already paid up front to get the vehicle on the road again. Not once have my mails been answered or calls returned. I have a pretty large policy with Discovery and it appears they don’t need my business. I think the lack of service is disgusting and requires that I relook at my portfolio. Claim number on policy is **********74. Easy to take my money each month but oh so slow when they need to act on the policy.,1
"I had a car accident  on the 26 october 2021 my car was towed away by discovery a couple of days later we received a email from them for the case number and some pics that we sent . We then received another email a week later that the car is a right off and we will be covered for it  and our claim was given over to a  a consultant that we haven't spoken to because her number goes onto voicemail . We sent emails to her that she hardly reply to. When we phone discovery  they say the car is paid off but the installment went off this month . When we asked the consultant  for proof of payment she sent a email back ""it was paid the 26/11/2021 thats her proof . We have been struggling for the past week for proof of payment none to date because the bank wants it. Never knew it was going to be so difficult and that we will have to spend so much money to get hold of discovery customer care  we really fed-up with there service and the way the handled our claim",1

Thank you Joash for all your effort.",4
"I had a bumper bashing 3 weeks ago, i had a Discovery ****le in my vehicle and they called me immediately to ask if i was ok without me even having to call and notify them. They automatically detected, i was well impressed. Things moved so fast and efficient, i didnt have to deal with anything, i was convinced i was in good hands and everything was gonna go smooth. They arranged a rental as per my scheme and everything was A OK.
WRONG... after a week i still had heard nothing back and made an inquiry via the email address i was given, perhaps this email got lost due to not ever receiving a response. A few emails of requests later, I then called for an update and was told they are waiting for a quote from the panel beater and should have it soon. 
2 weeks go by and i then get told oh... My car is still under warranty ( YES, Discovery you shoud know this by looking on your system on the day of the crash.) So due to my vehicle being under warranty the current panel beater is not allowed to fix it so now it has to go to an accredited dealer.  2 WEEKS WASTED due to the negligence of Discovery. My car then gets towed to the accredited panel beater, they move fast and get a quote, i receive a call to tell me it has been approved and the parts will be order, i express the fact that my rental is almost up and i cannot afford to be without a vehicle over December. To which the response was, your plan only covers 30 days. Fair enough, it does but it was not my fault that my vehicle sat at the wrong panel beater for 2  weeks. I then get a call from the panel beater to say, ""oh sorry we cannot fix your car this year"". 
I then emailed Discovery multiple times and called only to be ignored as if my email never reached their inbox. 
The negligence and ignorance is appalling. It is no one else's fault other than Discovery that this is now taking so long. The fact that my email requests for an update are ignored is disgusting customer service.  Something i thought they prided themselves in...  

WOULD NOT RECCOMEND",1
Michaela McPherson is always exeptional with her work and her passion about her job helping  her clients and us as Brokers knowing her through different broking companies that i worked  for she is always on the ball and you willl never drop a call with out her helping you .......She is really a great asset for discovery .......I amm always blown away with service that she gives with excelence,5

"My name is Rivona Gunasse. I’ve had 
an accident to which my insurance has rejected my claim. I would like to start from the 
beginning so you could also understand the entire story.
I am a chronic patient. I suffer with asthma. On the 18th of August 2021, I was 
experiencing difficulty breathing and had chest pain, hence I visited the doctor was 
given my usual medication, which is a steroid called prednisone. I also have a nebuliser 
at home. During the course of the weekend, I had trouble breathing again so I had then 
nebulised myself at home and I felt at ease. The very next day (Monday-23rd August), I 
experienced asthma attacks whilst at work (The learning Tree Academy-teacher) the 
office had then called for an ambulance and I was rushed to KwaDukuza Private 
hospital in Stanger, they stabilized me and I was sent home. During that night I was 
unwell again, I nebulised myself at home but it was not helping so then again, I was 
rushed to the hospital, stabilized and sent back home, by then I knew something was 
really wrong because normally my chest eases out, but instead I kept getting attacks. 
On Tuesday the 24th August I was rushed again to the hospital, they stabilized me and 
did a covid test for me, hence they admitted me because I just wasn’t getting better. 
The next morning, I was told I was covid positive and after consulting with my doctor 
he had discharged me and I was sent home to isolate. During my isolation period, apart 
from my heavy chest I was experiencing black outs from time to time mainly after I 
had taken a bath or if I walked outside in the sun. I just didn’t think much of it 
because I was weak during my isolation. I had to return back to school which I did on 
the 6th of September, during the first week back I had blacked out in my classroom, 
the ambulance was called and I was taken to the doctor. I was taken to the doctor 
because I had suffered a black out in my classroom, but I was treated for my asthma 
as he noticed that my chest was still not at ease. The doctor also stated that because 
of covid I had gotten weak and pale, my blood pressure was also low. He had then put 
me back on medication for my asthma and not for black outs and advised that I should 
rest as much as possible as my body still needed time to recover from covid. He had 
also advised me not to take hot showers as that can cause a black out especially with 
low blood pressure, which made sense as to why I was mainly experiencing black outs 
once I showered. My school was aware that I was still recovering from covid and that I 
still was weak because I just got back to work after 2 weeks of being at home and in bed most of the day. My body needed time to adjust back into its routine of being back 
to work, firstly I was not driving because I was still recovering from covid, secondly,
they helped me by allowing me to sit and teach as I would be tired of standing the 
entire day, they advised me it would be the best option until I feel better. This was 
done verbally because my principal and director understood that recovering from covid 
takes time. The first week back to work was hard as I was still adjusting but after the 
second week, I had regained my strength and I was able to go back into my routine. 
From the third week onwards (20th September) in school and at home I haven’t 
experienced black outs, which was until the 31th of October 2021, the day that the 
accident had taken place. I was driving back home from the mall in Stanger ( 
KwaDukuza Mall). I experienced difficulty breathing and before I could do anything, I 
had blacked out. I had woken up to loud bangs realising that I had went of the road and 
knocked into a tree. I was hysterical, scared and battling to breathe, when a kind 
gentlemen stopped by with his bakkie full of workers to assist me. He tried his best to 
calm me down, he called my husband and my husband was on his way as this accident 
occurred less than 5 minutes away from home. My car was half on the road which was 
dangerous to vehicles approaching, so to avoid another accident that gentleman’s 
workers had moved the car out of the road to the side of the road. By then my husband 
reached the scene, I was rushed home to get myself nebulised as I was near home. My 
husband contacted Discovery and told them about whatever had happened. They sent a 
tow truck and the car was the towed, we were informed that the car was going to be 
towed to my house, however that changed and the car was then towed to the tow truck 
companies yard. My husband was told over the phone that my car will go in for an 
assessment that Tuesday the 2nd of November as that Monday the 1st was a public 
holiday. Firstly, that didn’t happen, discovery kept re-allocating my claim to different 
people who didn’t even call me to check on what’s going on or to inform me about what’s 
going on. I had to contact them and make arrangements for car hire as I needed to get 
to work. My car hire was only arranged on the 3rd of November, and my car only went in 
for an assessment on the 15 November 2021. A guy named Desmond was in contact with 
me from the 5th of November as he needed me to fill in the consent to access 
information, he asked for all kinds of stuff, like my doctors contact details, proof of 
purchases made at the mall, pictures of my nebuliser and pump as well as my 
medication, my school principal’s contact details, also proof to say that I am asthmatic. 
I willingly gave him everything that he required. Whenever I asked for feedback, I 
never got proper feedback I had to keep messaging and calling to find out what’s going 
on, there wasn’t any proper communication from him. Last week Wednesday (24th
November), I had asked to speak to the manager as the process was taking too long and 
I have to give back the car hire hence I was stressed and worried. I spoke to the 
manager on Wednesday the 24th November, she had advised me I will receive feedback 
that Thursday the 25th on what they’ve decided to do. Thursday came there wasn’t any 
feedback, no calls or responses from them so I contacted Desmond who then stated I 
will receive feedback on Friday the 26th as they needed to present my claim in their forum meeting that morning. They had eventually contacted me around 1pm on Friday to 
say that they will only be able to give me feedback on Tuesday the 30th of November. 
Desmond contacted me to tell me that my claim was rejected because of the number of 
times I blacked out, in which they fail to realise this had taken place 2 months ago. He 
stated I needed to see a specialist regarding it, however I’ve been to my doctor during 
that time and they’ve never advised me to see a specialist. Firstly, I don’t see the need 
to keep going to the doctor and hospital especially during these tough times of covid as 
that is where I initially picked up covid, secondly due to covid my finances are not the 
best to keep visiting the doctor. Thirdly when I took up this insurance, they’ve never 
asked me if I have a medical condition, but according to Desmond I was told over the 
call that if anything changes, they should be notified of it. They didn’t state what 
changes they need to be notified of. Lastly, I was sent the rejection letter which 
stated that because of the measures my school had taken for me (allowing me to sit 
and teach), discovery needed to be aware of this and thus they’ve rejected my claim, I 
didn’t realise that I had to inform them regarding my covid situation it was not 
something that was planned, during those 2 weeks back at school my work colleague had 
driven and when I was back to normal and I was not experiencing any asthma attacks 
and black outs. Towards the end of September, I started driving again and like I said 
all was well until the day of the accident. I was not diagnosed or anything of that sort 
and neither was the school’s decision a written one, as I said they were concerned as 
they knew recovering from covid takes time, our body does not just go back to how it 
used to be. This is my first time being involved in an accident and Discovery has made it 
such an unpleasant experience, they are the worst people to deal with and I will make 
sure never to take up anything in future with them. Covid is a thing that has changed 
people’s life’s in many different ways, it’s not something we wish to get but in time we 
eventually heal from this, it is a traumatising situation to be in, but Discovery cares 
about absolutely nothing.",1

"Claim No: **********

The above mentioned claim was lodged on the 6th November 2021, on the 11th of November, I needed to contact Discovery Insure to try and get some sort of way forward, on the morning of the 12th, I received a text message that my car needed to be assessed that morning, luckily Discovery warned me on the 14th about this (2 days later), I then followed up on the 24th for some sort of progress, a back to front message was sent to me as authorization (unable to read it) and to date have not been contacted, I have followed up again today and await some sort of response.  It is unfortunate that I have had to deal with Discovery Insure 3 times in 2021 and not once have I received adequate service, it is truly shocking....",1
Once again -great service from Natasha at Broker Servicing! Thanks so much :),5
"Excellent Service - Busi Taliwe - Thank you Busi for the amazing service, much appreciated, I can enjoy my afternoon outdoor runs now",5
"I have been with Discovery Insure for a couple of years, but am thinking it's time to change. Due to good driving, we're supposed to receive 50% of our fuel spend back, and this suddenly dropped to 20%. I tried to contact them and eventually received a response that my annual Tiger Wheel and Tyre check was due. So my fiance took the car in, to be told that it's not their check it's the one done at Discovery direct. This can't be correct as this was a once off check for a specific extended warranty option! Subsequently I've received a message saying my TWT check is due, over a month late! And still no resolution on the report that TWT won't do the check. So we've lost several hundred Rand's the last month and probably will this month again!",2
"I want to give a big thanks to Michaela McPherson from Discovery Insure! She was so kind, quick to help and very efficient. Totally made my day.",5
"I cancelled my policy with Discovery Insure due to its pathetic service. 3 months later, they take debit my account again without any notification. When I call them, they say it was due to the tracking devices still in the 2 vehicles. One was removed by them on the 4th of October and the 2nd car is in their possession as it was a car they wrote off. I held on for more that 25 minutes for them to get their necessary confirmations. Such bad service yet again. They should honestly stay in their lane for medical aids as they dont know what they are doing when it comes to short-term insurance. They take money out of my account without letting me know and its their mistake and now I have to wait for 7-10 days before they give it back. Who is going to cover the costs of my rejected debit orders due to them taking this money out of my account?",1
"Switching from Outsurance to Discovery Insure has been the worst mistake I made this year. My wife and I were mugged by a gang on a hike at Constantia Nek in Cape Town, they took our cellphones, wallets, my wifes wedding ring and our car. I found after the fact that none of the stuff we lost is covered as we only have content cover when we are in our house, I dont understand why this wasnt sold as part of the cover. My car was found and moved to the police pound and it has still not been picked up 1 week later and to top it off the discovery reps are ghosting me. I am happy with discovery medical and vitality but stay away from discovery insure they are undercooked and I am switching back to outsurance",1
Quick and helpful response from the Discovery Insure Household and Car Breakdown Emergency Service number yesterday when stuck at work yesterday with a car that would not start. Prompt arrival of help and a quick jump-start saved the day for us - thank you to Zunaid Joseph & William Machitiso from the Emergency Services department.,5
I added a new vehicle to my insurance policy and the cover incepted 29 November 2021 but Discovery has still not debited my account?? Is my car insured? Why are you taking so long to insure an asset you accepted?,1
Discovery has double debited my account and no one can explain why. I want my money back and they are telling me stories about logging queries,1
I just wanted to thank Discovery Insure for their speedy resolution of my claim. We have been hit hard with the rainy season with additional disasters in our home. We had our Solar Technician (who services our geyser every two years) in to service our solar geyser two weeks ago and what he found was not good. Our geyser was leaking. Etienne our technician tried in van to see if he could weld the geyser to prevent the need for major costs - sadly when he started the whole geyser was corroded and could not be fixed. We went ahead on our own risk and replaced the geyser in the hope that Discovery would come through for us - AND THEY DID. My interactions were completely online and this morning I received a message to say the claim had been approved. I got regular SMS's to update me on progress. Thank you Discovery for your prompt service.,5
I constantly wonder whether the hoops I am made to are worth being with Discovery at all. For nearly two months I have tried to communicate issues with my Drive sensor on my vehicle resulting in drive points and rewards not being assigned. Now due to work commitments I cannot get the vehicle to a Tyger Wheel and Tyre to replace the sensor as they have finally asked to do as the vehicle is stationery and I am working long hours for two weeks now yet they cannot deliver the sensor or award the points as a ‘sensor needs to be fitted’ which I already have but which is apparently faulty as they have taken their own sweet time to figure out. I am constantly being tested by Discovery and all their services and it’s getting tiresome.,1
Discovery insure deduct extra monthly premium of R2200 for insurance of our 2 cars after acknowledging the cancellation.  30 day notice was given in writing.,1
"Well done to Discovery Insure on your speedy service in resolving my claim.  Your building specialist Marnus Louw was very quick and punctual. My claim was lodged on Sunday morning, he arrived here on Monday and by Tuesday my claim was approved.  Done and dusted in like 1, 2,3.  That is what we as customers expect from our insurers.  Well done Marnus and thank you Discovery Insure.  High Five !!!",5
"Such terrible and poor service from agent Thandeka McCune.  I logged my claim with discovery on the 27th of November and i have not received a single call from Thandeka Mncube despite me leaving countless emails for the consultant to contact me. 

I  am so disappointed in the manner in which this claim has been handled 

I received a call day before yesterday and asked the advisor to call me back in 10 minutes as I was on a work call on my landline.I was never called back. No email received 
Absolutely nothing since I reported this claim

The contact number is always busy 
My claim advisor Thandeka has never ever contacted me.  I'm so disappointed 

Complete disregard for customers opinions. Discovery you are dropping the ball",1

"I've been trying to get Discovery to change the speed limit of our suburbs"" streets to more than 20km for months! We get penalties for speeding DAILY as we dare drive more than 20km/h in a street around the suburb. It was never like this. Changed Aug. I'm missing weekly plays on Vitality as well as Discovery Miles for good driving. Phoned repeatedly... Discovery wants a photo of a sign with correct speed limit on?!? Where will you find that in a JHB suburb? Getting really fed-up. Nobody really escalates the ""escalated"" issue :(",1
"Poor service from agent Mahlomola Sekgotlaboraga. I logged my claim with discovery on the 19th of November and i have not received a single call from Mahlomola Sekgotlaboraga despite me leaving countless emails for the consultant to contact me. 

Without my approval the agent booked my car in for repairs Without even confirming with me if i am comfortable using the panal beater,  seems like discovery puts you in a corner and bullies you to use who ever they want. 

Complete disregard for customers opinions. Discovery you are dropping the ball

"I spoke to Shafick Allow with the intention of leaving Discovery Insure and explained my issue and reason for leaving Discovery. So, the reason I am leaving a review is because Shafick in a very professional manner explained the benefits of being insured by Discovery, as well as the value and after that conversation, I decided to stay with Discovery. Now, I think the main reason was because he understood where I was coming from but also responded in a down to earth manner and made me see that staying with Discivery is the best option. Thank you Shafick for your time and the Excellent service rendered, it is through your intervention that Discovery has retained a customer.",5

I was told I must have car inspected within 5 days otherwise I'm not covered, but they failing on their side to have that sorted out, next thing if I need to claim they'll be rejected.. Customer service is the worst, when they need you to take the cover they will call even 10 times a day, but when there's an issue, no calls, and emails replied after days...",2
"I forwarded a mail on Sunday regarding a claim that I had submitted on your app for a vehicle accident that took place on the 7th November. The claim was submitted on November the 8th. ref number **********

Up until this weekend past, I have had no contact from Discovery whatsoever. I have taken it upon myself to try & assist where I can, even going so far as driving back to Modimolle where the accident took place, to see if there was outstanding paperwork or anything that would potentially be delaying the claim. All of this was outlined in my previous review, in which you responded that someone would be in touch.

After my mail on Sunday, an e-mail was received stating that the vehicle was at Auction SA in Centurion or Pretoria, 3 weeks after the accident & now the vehicle was going to be assessed....3 weeks after the accident.
Part of my policy provides me with cover for a rental vehicle, which is fine,  but the real issue here is that the rental vehicle will need to be returned shortly & I have a family vacation planned where a mode of transport by road will be required.

On Monday, I was e-mailed that I would be contacted by a representative from discovery, and here we are on Wednesday....still waiting.

When I signed up for Discovery, I was under the impression that I would be receiving the best service that the industry has to offer. The service would have been better had I been covered by the ANC, at least then I would know what I'm in for . A simple call would have been great. But I'm sure your employees are busy signing everyone up for Gap cover, what with the doctors & hospital increases next year & you'll get to me....eventually.",1

Standard Bank, the other insurer, have already paid out their share of the money within 30 days. What makes it more apalling, is that Discovery insurance ignores rewuests, phone calls, any escalations to their customer complaints site- I do not know what else to do? Next step I assume would be the ombudsman to get MY MONEY back.",1

"Discovery Insure has quite literally given me the worst service I have ever experienced. I was involved in a car accident on the 11th October 2021. Discovery had the vehicle towed to their choice in panel beater, and gave authorization to repair on the 15th October 2021. I have been messed around lied to manipulated and broken promises given by the panel beater for 1.5 months, and they still have not even started with the vehicle repair, despite parts available and sitting at the supplier. 

I have approached Discovery insure for assistance in this as they are my insurer and have put the car in this particular panel beater. I have sent my claims advisor numerous emails, not only does she not bother to Respond, she does not even acknowledge the mail. I have called Discovery Insure 19 times in the last month, trying to get assistance, and I am forced to speak to the claims department, who inevitably put me on hold for up to 1.5 hours, they just regurgitate what the panel beater tells them which is ""there is no parts, the car will be ready on Friday"", This has happened 4 Fridays in row, I have personally confirmed parts are at the supplier/ dealership, the dealership has also been begging to have the parts paid for and collected as they are carrying the cost, and every Friday that has been promised the car still has not been started on. Discovery refuse to investigate, and just repeat what was said to them. I have requested to talk to a manager multiple times, and either get put on hold again for up to 1.5 hours, or get promised someone will call me back which they never do. The One and only time I managed to speak to a manager, she was rude, would not listen to my story, and made it very clear that my request for her to help was inconveniencing her and annoying her. she too said she would follow up and revert back to me and this did not happen. I have had on more than one occasion told the advisors to please read the notes on the system as I keep having to explain my story from scratch, and they have told me their is no notes on the system... (Keeping adequate notes and records is in fact a requirement by the FAIS act). I have requested on about 5 different occasions for the complaints department or procedure, each time I get told something different, things like ""They don't have a Complaints department"", ""I need to rather speak to a manager"" (who are never available and i get put on hold for up to 1.5 hours), Calls randomly cut as I ask for the complaints department (this has happened more than once). One person gave me the complaints email address, I sent an email explaining my story, no body has responded or acknowledged my email. 

after the numerous emails and 19 phone calls of exorbitant lengths, and a month and a half trying to get Discovery to help me in either pushing the panel beater to finish the job, or remove the car and take it to a more competent panel beater, I have achieved nothing at all, other than copious amounts of stress as I am forced to deal with this alone, and loss of money as I rely on my car for my income, and the hire vehicle was only valid for the first 30 days. Discovery at no point has cared or attempted to assist at all in any shape or form.",1

"I have received top class assistance from Shafick Allow yesterday when we reviewed my insurance with Discovery Insure.  He was very helpful, and I had a very good experience with him, and we completed the updated details regarding my insurance very quickly. Shafick is working in the retentions department at Discovery Insure. I will recommend him anytime.",5
"On the 21st of September 2021, I had a house break in incident. The perpetrators took Car keys, Gate remotes, 65” Hisence TV, Carbon Road bike and drove off with my Range Rover Evoque. 
I reported the incident immediately through the Discovery emergency assist hotline and to SAPS. 
Soon as the perpetrators were leaving, I tried to track the vehicle from the Discovery Insure App and realised that the tracker was not working anymore. It was showing that the vehicle is still parked at my house.
A few minutes after I had reported the incident, I got a call back from the discovery control room from a male agent whose name I cannot remember as I was still in a state of shock. He was checking how I was and advising me that I have access to a security guard but I would have to provide shelter and that I have access to trauma counselling. He then asked if I had a second tracker on the vehicle and I told him that I do not know if there is one. 
The following day on the 22nd of September 2021 at 9:17pm I got a call from a person called Sibukeli, (similar voice to the previous caller from the control room) from a cell phone number +**********7 saying that he is calling from discovery. He would like to find out how I would like to proceed with the claim. Whether I wanted to wait until the vehicle was recovered or proceed with the claim. I told him that I don’t know how the procedures work, you should be the one advising. I also told him that someone else from discovery had contacted me regarding the claim, so I will send them the documents they asked for. He then asked me to cc him on all the communications and sent me an SMS with his email address. The email address is ***********.
A few hours later at around 23:00Hrs I get a call from police constables claiming to be from Ivory Park saying that they had recovered my vehicle somewhere in Tembisa/Ivory Park and where the vehicle is parked the tow truck cannot easily reach it so they were wondering if I had the spare keys to the vehicle. I told them I do have spare keys but I do not keep them but my sister does. The police constable said they can dispatch a vehicle from CAP security who they work with to fetch the spare key from my sister. I did not disclose who my sister was and where she stays because I realised that something was not right. I dismissed the call and immediately called National Police, who then advised me not to give anyone the spare keys reasons being; 
1.	There is a procedure that the police are supposed to follow, they should just Tow the vehicle to the police impound and not ask for any spare keys.
2.	 There is a police case opened, they have to communicate with the investigating officer not me
3.	The police impound does not work at night 
So National police advised me that it was a Scam and then dispatched a vehicle from Douglasdale Police Station to check what was going on. 
As I was speaking to the National police, I started getting calls from the police officers and I kept ignoring them. Next thing soon as I dropped the call I’m getting a call from my sister saying there is someone at her gate from CAP security saying that they are here to fetch spare keys. I immediately informed her not to give anyone the keys. The driver from CAP security also called from my sister’s gate saying he has arrived and I asked him where he got the information about my sister’s address and he said he was given coordinates by his control room. I called the CAP security control room and they would not disclose who gave them the instruction to dispatch the security guy but they are working with Discovery and the police. The police officers from ivory Park called with the following cell phone numbers; +**********4 and +**********4.
The police from Douglasdale arrived also after a short while and I gave them the events of what has been taking place and they went to my sister’s place to check what was going on there. They got there and spoke to the security guard from CAP security and somehow he managed to convince them that it was a legit recovery. The same policeman from Douglasdale called me back with the CAP security guard saying I should give them the key because the police officers that were calling me earlier are legit cops. I continued to refuse to release the spare key and asked them to be the ones to escort me to the so called recovery site and they refused and left. 
I continued to get aggressive calls from the Ivory Park police, that time with a different cell phone number and I still refused to give them the spare key. Eventually there was a call from Discovery from the same Sibukeli person from Discovery, now calling from the discovery control room landline number that called me back when I reported the theft. He was telling me to give the spare keys to the CAP security person. Discovery will take full responsibility of what happens. I continued to refuse to give out the keys. 
The police officers continued calling me, threatening that they are going to leave the car they cannot guard the car overnight. I still refused to give out the keys as I was now fully aware of what was going on. I then asked them to send a police Van to come fetch me and take me and my brother to where the vehicle is, and that was when they stopped calling. I also then switched off my phone as it was now around 01:00Hrs. That was the last I heard about the fake vehicle recovery. 
I reported the incident to Discovery the following morning of the 23rd of September 2021, and they said they would investigate and come back to me. No one called me back.
On the 28th of September, I was just going through my phone and just checked the discovery app, I realised that the tracker was back online and my car was now showing that it was somewhere on Main Reef Road, I phoned Discovery control room and they said they would verify and call back. They never called back. I called the police and they came and checked the location and told me that it looks like a police impound in Benoni and advised me to go and check. I called Discovery back and that’s when they confirmed that yes it was indeed my vehicle and it was at the Police impound and that was that. There was no advice on next steps or anything. 
I went the morning of the 29th of September to the police impound as advised by the police and cleared the vehicle out of the impound. The paperwork at the police impound showed that the vehicle had been dropped off on the 22nd of September 2021 at 3:30pm contrary to what the tracking device showed that is 23rd of September 2021 around 1:30pm. 
There was no feedback from Discovery regarding the incident that I had reported, until a friend posted something regarding the incident on the Discovery twitter page. I was later on called and told by Discovery that it was part of procedure that their consultants can call from their private phones at that time of the night as Mr Sibukile had done, at the same time they could have done better. That was that from Discovery.  No explanation as to how the tracker came back online a few days later. Why they couldn’t find the vehicle themselves as it had been parked at the police impound for 5 days. How the CAP security got hold of my sister’s details? All those questions remain unanswered to date. 
Over and above that trauma, I have not received my vehicle back since the 30th of September 2021 that I dropped it off at Riverside Auto Body for Assessment under Discovery Claim. The car had damages and had been stripped during the robbery. There was no proper assessment done on the vehicle leading to parts going on back orders twice. I have emailed Discovery asking for a courtesy vehicle, with no response to date from Discovery.",1

"When I first signed up with Discovery Insure, it sounded amazing. Unfortunately, what you are told and what you receive are world’s apart.

Firstly,  if insured with Discovery Insure, you need to fill up at BP or Shell to qualify for cash back. I reside less than one kilometre from a BP filling station. However, the service at that station is so bad, that I am forced to fill up at Engen. Over the past month I have, in total, lost out on about R700 worth of points because on 2/11, the garage was out of petrol. Then from 19-21/11 the garage’s system was “offline”. This is in addition to the usual poor service from the BP in question. Why must I drive 9km to the next closest BP to fill up? It is truly time that Discovery partnered up with a decent petrol company.

Secondly, the DQ tracker deducts points for using the GPS feature on a phone. That means you will lose 9 points on a journey for cell phone usage, even if you do not touch your phone from the moment you start driving. 

Thirdly, I have 2 cars on my insurance policy, one that belongs to my mom. When I was “sold” the insurance product, I was told that I would get a percentage of my insurance premiums back if my mom did under a certain number of kms a month. My mom averages 200km per month, but this never happens. In fact, her app constantly tells her she is the same number of DQ points away from gold status EVERY month.

When I complained to Discovery, I was told to send them my slips. I do not keep slips, especially not ones from Engen. Nor do I ask for my Mom’s slips. Does Discovery think our cars have been running on fresh air for the month??? They claim to know how many kms you do in a month. Why do they need the slips when they can track your fuel expenses and your mileage? The response to my complaint is that if I don’t agree with the DQ tracker, I can phone them. Why must I phone them when I am emailing them?

I think Discovery insurance product is false advertising and I hope this review will caution prospective customers as such.",1
"The following email was sent today.
""Natasja,

The Discovery Call Centre advised me that Thandeka reports to you. Hopefully this is correct, as I am completely dissatisfied with the lack of any kind of response from her regarding this claim. None of my emails either to her or ***********, are answered. I have called countless times to speak to, only to be told she is unavailable.

Today, I made four calls to the Call Centre, all of which were terminated by the consultant. Finally I got hold of Katlego, who is the only person who actually helped!

Please can you advise why Discovery’s service is so bad? Can you also advise me by return email, what the status is of my claim?

I do have your phone number, so, should I not hear back from you today, I shall call you tomorrow.

Oh, and by the way, we have a heavy hailstorm here as I am writing this, which has further damaged the umbrella, which is the subject of my claim.""",1

"My car stopped very randomly on my way back from the airport. In obvious distress I called Discovery insure emergency department for roadside assistance. Msuthu helped me organise someone with a jump-starter and towed my car. The peace of mind it gave me was unmatched

Very friendly and good service from Shamaine Naidoo.  Wanted to cancel my cover to another provider but she managed to change my mind by trying to match the offer I had got from the other providers.,5
On my claims history there is an accidental damage for R5455. My last claim was for attempted hijack on 2 Oct 2021. Fair enough you are not willing to reinstate my policy after such long time and my challenges started beginning of Covid however I never had a claim in November. Can I have an amended document please,1
"After just one month with them
I’m ready to find another company to insure my  vehicle with. The people within the company doesn’t even know how their own ‘tracking devices’ work , continue to give me wrong information at my expense and now that I found out that I was lied to the whole way into this, they tell me that it can only be rectified in more than a month from now. 

The premiums are way too high and certainly not worth the inconsistent information. So glad I didn’t need to claim from them as I fear everything I was told when signing Up was all lies! So disappointed. Be careful!!",1
"I have now lodged two claims for items that were damaged on my house. Despite frequent follow ups made by myself and promises made by Discovery Insure Agents, weeks have passed and neither claim has been finalized, with no work being completed, althoughg both claims were approved by Discovery Insure. SHOCKING AND UNACCEPTABLE SERVCE!! Does it really take weeks to get a claim sorted out?",1
I had fantastic service from Tokozani Mbawu I getting a few queries resolved and claims paid.  Brilliant and friendly.   Thank you for making my Friday,5
"I have a love hate relationship with Discovery Insure. In 2020 I made the decision to leave the insurance company, (after having inter alia numerous issues with accessing my dashboard) and join another company who offered me a competitive rate and better service. I came across Merlin van Wyk who assisted me with all my issues promptly and who went above and beyond any agent at Discovery has. He still continues to do so and honestly I'm still at Discovery because of the amazing service he has rendered (even on his leave days).",4
"I'm taking this moment to appreciate Natasha Johnson. She's a hungry person, friendly, good at what she does and a good asset to the company",3
Agent was really helpful and friendly,5
"Very good service. I have two cars insured with them, all competitors have failed to offer less. I pay no access. They always approve claims. Now approved two claims at once. I can't choose any other. Discovery Insure is the best!!!!!",5
Fantastic service from Shafick Allow.,5
"I had the pleasure of dealing with Peter Thabo Mokoena yesterday the 25th of Nov. 21, as I need assistance with a tow truck for my vehicle - he calmed me down completely then organized the tow truck that was here in 20 mins and then still called me twice to make sure that I was ok and if my vehicle had arrived at the designated site - thank you to much Thabo, you are a wonderful human being, I wish there were more people like you in the world!!!!",5

"Vitality drive points are not deducted in a set manner. I noticed that I lost 20 points for speeding. On an email request sent to Discovery the reply from the agent was “Please be advised that speeding is speeding, regardless if it was harsh or mild speeding, the client will be penalized.”
Firstly, that is not the way you speak/write to one of your customers!!!!!
I do understand that I will be penalized, but 20 points for one penalty is just ridiculous. Normally the points deducted will be 1 or 2. I do suspect that your system is being manipulated manually to ensure that your clients don’t receive the full benefit that you promote.
Please could you clarify how points are deducted for offences.",2
"Took out a policy through ""Discovery agents"" - who it turns out are actually DGC - BLUE MERCURY. The advisor Sebastian, gave a premium of R3800 - when I went onto the policy documents the premium shows R4300. I phoned DGC - BLUE MERCURY and spoke to Sebastian and told him if he cannot give the premium he promised on the phone then he must cancel the policy. I went onto my discovery now, and see that the policy is still showing active to commence on 01/12/2021. This is absolutely unscrupulous behaviour by someone representing Discovery and to LIE to a client on the phone is totally unacceptable. I want this policy cancelled immediately and to understand why this agent has been allowed to operate and if this company DGC - BLUE MERCURY is actually a representative of Discovery.",1
"Absolutely disgusted with discovery!!!!

an agent called me today just around 430 pm- i was busy but made a few minutes to speak to her. before she went too far i explained that i do not want to engage if she will be checking itc because it impacts my credit profile which i am trying to build.

i asserted this three times to each time she responded it will not require checks , even insisting that  ""other companies do that but they dont"". She then proceeded to convince me to take a follow up call because an agent ""is already working on my quote and will call me back shortly"" ------- 

When this said agent called me back, sihle was his name  , he started off by saying he can pick up my Vehicle details on the itc report. What itc report exactly??????

He clarified that discovery does check itc and that the first agent should not have misled me.

I feel very let down by this and discovery has caused me trust issues - i will be cancelling my vitality and any affiliation with this bank as a result.

very very poor .",1
"2months and counting Discovery has not fixed my roof after a hail storm , they have sent incompetent service providers to attend to the roof repairs,the company only attend to the repairs 7 weeks later ,and still did not repair my roof, my is still leaking and further damages from discoyvery service provider.Now they appointed a 2nd roofing service provider who confirms the bad job of the 1st service provider and now discovery refuses to pay the 2nd service provider in full to repair the roof and the damages from the 1st service provider,now they are looking for excuses to not repair my roof.",1

I spoke to Mathibedi Chueu regarding my premium review and he assisted me greatly in reducing my premium and access.,5
"I have had a vehicle claim since May 2021. All the damage on The vehicle was not repaired as this was an oversight on the assessor. I have been struggling since May 2021 when I collected my car at the panel beaters to get discovery to approve the additionals and get my vehicle booked in to have it repaired. It has been authorised and now discovery comes back to me to tell me that I only have 4 days left of my Avis car rental.  This is after spending over R1000 in phone calls to discovery in the past 6 months and over 30-50 minutes of my time with each call. 

We pay over R10500 per month on our discovery products and this service is absolutely ****.  Pls do not even consider discovery insure as a possible insurance option. They have the absolute worse service ever!  I am beyond upset!!!",1

"The agent asked me on email to prepare documents to be collected by courier. I asked what documents she responded with only 1 document name. 
Courier collects that 1 document. 
Problem:
1. After proping now another document is requested which was not mentioned when i asked
2. Agent uses abbreviations in email assuming i understand them
3. Agents shares forwarded emails with typos with abbreviations leaving me still in the dark of what's required or next steps 
1. Throughout the claim process updates only get given when i ask
2. Have to send multiple emails before getting a response
3. Agent and manager both on email yet neither respond 

My claim still remains unresolved! 

Discovery's Service over the years has taken a serious dive. Their fancy ads do not match their poor service we receive.",1

"My fridge died 2 days ago. I called Discovery, waiting on average 8min to speak to someone and then got cut off during the chat with the consultant as my airtime ran out. I waited to for a call back but they did not bother to call back so I logged the claim online. I called them the following day to follow up and they said they would assign someone to come out and do an inspection/assessment on the fridge. I didn't get a call from anyone regarding this and called again today to see what is going on, wasting more of my airtime. I was told that they will call the company who does the inspections/assessments and they did as I got a call from Chatatech Jhb almost immediately who said they they have 1 person in Cape Town to assist with this and that he can only come tomorrow. My fridge is not cooling at all and all my food is spoiled. If this is how all claiming is handled through a big/respectable company such as Discovery, I should be looking for a new insurer as their service is mediocre.",1

"For the past two weeks ,going on three my car has been taken to an assessment centre where no information was given with regards to the faults on my car , from there it was sent to a panel beater where again there was no feedback given as to the issues with my car, upon calling multiple times for feedback, where the service delivery was disgusting, each agent I spoke to told me the same thing ""there are no notes given"" , meaning they cannot tell me what is wrong. A call was given to me by the panel beater that my car was ready for collection and on arrival I was informed that a scratch was repaired but they were instructed by Discovery not to repair any other damages on the car that were caused by the accident I placed a claim for.",1

She made a extremely traumatic experience a little less traumatic, and I thank you for that Joelene. keep up the good work!",5
Loved the service provided by Tasmina Nair. You are a great person and asset for your company ☺️,5
"We have been insured with discovery for years, we have a tracker and vitality drive.  We were owed R750 for the cash back and we received R80, this was in June. My broker has not been able to assist with the balance and I keep getting the run around. Now we get ZERO cash backs 😡",1
"On 29/10/2021 - My car was stolen and recovered on the same day. At first I was super impressed with how quickly discovery recovered my car.
But It has been almost 4 weeks since then and I still don't know if they are going to repair my car or write it off. I have spent hours on calls I had to make to discovery to try and find out what is going on and all they keep telling me is they are waiting for the report form the accessor. Chante Davis that is supposed to handle my claim is an absolute nightmare to get a hold of. When I applied for my insurance I was told that I get a 30 day car hire but they don't tell you in 30 days they can get nothing done and then they only want to give you a 5 day extension on your car hire but they still can't tell you if your car will be written off or repaired so how on earth is a 5 day extension going to help. It takes you 5 min to get through to a claims consultant and they are absolutely useless because nothing gets done. When you ask to speak to a manager or supervisor you get placed on hold for over 10 min. If you drop the call because you have been waiting too long, no one calls you back and you get absolutely no feedback from anyone regarding your claim. Sending e-mails is worth nothing because you don't even get any response. I will from here on forward tell everyone I know to stay far away form discovery the expensive rates you pay hoping that you will get great customer service is not worth it at all. Monday I had a friend ask me if moving from Outsurance to Discovery is worth it and after I told her how I'm struggling with my claim she has decided to stay with outsurance. If anyone knows of an insurance with excellent customer service please let me know so I can change over to them.
My claim reference number is **********",1
"I have received the worse services from Discovery Insure, firstly the broker used to call me all the time before I signed up. Come claim stage he never replied to my calls and emails, when I had a claim GIT I was told a different story from what my broker Johannes Swafo told me, I was debited every month for GIT and want to be reimbursed for all those debit orders because it was false advertising. Secondly someone changed my debit order date without my consent now Discovery debits my account randomly and that messes up my account. I was told I'll reimbursed for the random debit order by the 22 Nov but to date nothing was done. Discovery needs to communicate with the client before debating the account. My account needs to be debited on the 25th and I have never skipped a payment. Discovery is quick to debit me, but services delivery as not as quick as debit order. The broker/ admin/ claims stuff are the worse.1. I want you to listen to the records with my broker Johannes regarding  GIT and tell me what if what the claims department wanted from me was discussed. 2. I want to tell you finance team I want my money,not even a call to apologize like you did last time and not to debit me randomly. And I want feedback before close of business.
I'm so angry 😠😡",1
"Good experience, did policy cancellation and Tasmina offered me various options before cancellation.",4
"Acknowledgement and thanks to Discovery Insure on the great service I always receive from them.  They are fast, efficient and overall awesome.  My go to person is Vanessa Louw (shared value team) and she sorts out whatever query / problem I may have.  Well done Discovery :-)",5
Insulting to know that your claim is not important to Discovery Insure. We’ve been requesting and requesting and requesting but they keep on doing the same repetitive thing over and over with no communication. Once we actually get to speak to a consultant then they understand and apologise but as soon as the phone call is done then they request the same thing again. We can’t even get a hold of Discovery Insure. This is pathetic. Thanks discovery for such great service. Worst experience ever!!,1

"My car was stolen but recovered by Discovery Insure on Wednesday the 17th of November 2021.  I was quite impressed as it was recovered within an hour of reporting it stolen.  Unfortunately, the thieves had already stripped it.  After Discovery reported that the car was recovered, I was told that it has minor internal damage and will be towed to an impound centre.  I then received an sms with the claim number, the name of the claims consultant and contact numbers. I found them to be impressive. 

The next day, Thursday the 18th of November, I went to the vehicle impound thinking I was going to drive out with my car only to find that the damage is major, the car does not even have a starting mechanism.  I called Discovery while at the impound centre to arrange for the car to be towed to a safer place but was kept for too long on the line after requesting my allocated claims consultant that I eventually dropped the call.  No one called me back.  I called later on the same day to make the arrangements.  I was happy to talk to any consultant to assist me.  I was dismayed when they asked for details concerning the incident considering that I told emergency assist what happened when I reported it stolen, Discovery's ground team recovered the car, knew about its state and its whereabouts.  If I had not called, when was Discovery going to get the details from me?  After all that, I was told to submit a copy of my ID and proof of ownership since I said it was paid up.  As exasperated as I was, later on the day I submitted the ID and proof of ownership and made a note that the car has to be towed as soon as possible as it might be stripped further where it was.  The guards at the impound centre informed me that they have a challenge as nyaope addicts strip cars at the centre.  The next day, Friday the 19th of November, I received an email informing me that a service provider was appointed to remove my car from the impound and that the SP will contact me.  No further communication from there.  Mind you, I took up a policy that gives me 30 days car hire (I verified this on my policy documents). Up to this point no one asks me about car hire.  I eventually requested car hire through the Discovery App and nothing.

On Friday, the 19th of November, I received a call from Discovery.  I thought I was going to get progress report regarding my claim and my car.  But no, the person wanted to arrange for a second tracker to be installed on my car.  At this point I lost hope.  I knew there is no communication externally, but I realised that there is also no internal communication at Discovery Insure. 

Today is Tuesday the 23rd of November still no communication.  I decided to call Discovery again to find out what is happening with my claim. Their appointed services provider still has not contacted me. I did not bother asking for a specific claims consultant and spoke to whomever answered my call.  I asked about the progress of my claim and car hire.  I was put on hold while the consultant got hold of Avis.  He then asked me if I was not contacted by the service provider, I said no.  He put me on hold again to contact the service provider.  As I was waiting the call was dropped.  No one has tried to call me back.  On the upside, Avis called to arrange car hire.  I asked that the car be delivered to me.  The only available time is tomorrow at 15:00, I agreed.  I then went to check on the App for progress on my claim, no progress posted.  When I checked up on the car hire on the App there is a notification that I have 14 days car hire remaining.  The count down has began even before I take possession of the hired car.  I have 14 days remaining not 29.

It has been a week, there is no progress.  As far as I know, my car is still at the vehicle impound stripped further my nyaope addicts.  Twice I have received an sms from Discovery telling me to park my car in the garage because of the bad weather predictions.  It would be funny if it was not so sad.  I have been paying my premiums without any problems.  It don't even ask for a yearly review just pay whatever yearly escalation no questions asked.  Is this how Discovery Insure treats all its clients or is this an exception? It must be the norm, my twin brother had the exact same experience with Discovery Insure in October last year. How much longer do I still have to wait for communication? Discovery Insure knows. How much longer do I have to wait till I receive my car fully fixed? Who knows?!  My premium paying behind will keep guessing.",1
Mathibedi Chueu from the Retentions department was of great help,5
"A1 service from Nomfundo Sibeko, she resolved a query that took others over 3 weeks for overs, in less than an hour. As she said herself, she took accountability for my issue, which had nothing to do with her and she resolved it.

"I was about to cancel my policy with Discovery Insure after liaising with numerous Retention consultants who promise to ensure that my account issues will sorted for the past 3 months. I came to the last straw with Discovery Insure where I called the Retention department to actually wanting to cancel my policy and but I ended up speaking Shafick Allow who assisted me and request me give him a chance to fix this issue for me. He kept to his word and communicated to me from beginning to end via email and telephonically. I wish I had spoken with him over 3 month ago when I initially called discovery.

"Discovery Insure replaced my windscreen in May with a pirate windscreen. I highlighted my unhappiness with this windscreen within a week of it being replaced. Nothing. Due to the pirate windscreen the windscreen wiper sensor does not connect and does not work. Spoken to Discovery on a weekly basis, have escalated it to claims managers and still NOTHING!! Discovery blames Auto Boys and of course, no response from Auto Boys even after their own consultants tried for two hours to fix the botched job - it needs to be placed with an agent approved windscreen, not a pirate one!

I have sent numerous emails to Discovery including their complaints for weeks now doing follow ups no response at all. The Supervisor by the name of Natasja Badenhosrt and their complaints department are not responding to my emails.
My car has been with the dealership for more than a month and they are still investigating.

"Absolutely shocking service from Discovery Insure. We are waiting for a response from Discovery so that we can get our vehicle repaired, but they are definitely not taking our business seriously. We are a third party claim and wow, I am so glad that they are not my insurer. Numerous emails, back and forth, from consultant to broker, and after more than 3 months we still have not had our vehicle repaired. (Bumped by my neighbour who is with Discovery). 

I have been very patient and had I known that they would be so slack, would have just gone straight to my insurance provider. I was told to work through them  however, and was under the impression that we would lose our no-claim bonus if we went through our own insurance. 

All proof of correspondence is on record. Somehow I dont think it matters to Discovery anyway, as even after ""escalating the issue"" we still have had no contact from them.

Simply disgusting, especially considering that they are considered one of the ""premium"" insurers.",1
My house burnt down on Monday 13 September 2021. My Broker Esme Theron was on there and immediately submitted the claim with foto's.  The following day we met the Assessor Grant Schuster at the house. He was very professional. He explained that he would like an expert to come and have a look. Thursday 16 September we met the Specialist Danny Joubert at the house.  He did his investigation and took the time to explain to us what he saw and what he thinks was the cause of the fire.  He did ask if he could take some time and do a thorough look. We left him to do his job. The above mentioned people was in contact the whole time and we knew exactly what was happening.  Two weeks later we met with The Broker and Assessor and were informed that our claim will be paid in full. Thank you to all involved.,5

"I would like to thank Solofelang Mosiapoa from the Emergency Services department for a wonderful service I received. My car got stuck in the evening, while there was loadshedding, therefore the network signal was horrible and Solofelang was very patient with me and getting me assistance.",5
"Why does it always have to come to me having to complain about issues on social media before I get feedback from discovery?! 
 Ref **********
This is completely ridiculous. I have asked repeatedly that the issues with my sensors and apps be looked into and have had no response.
My wife’s vehicle keeps registering trips that it has not taken and claims that there was no phone present resulting in her not achieving drive goals and negatively affecting our fuel Cashbacks. The sensor in my vehicle is not registering trips at all and all I receive is a ridiculous message about enabling the settings on my phone which are fine because they woke when I drive my wife’s car.
I would like this issue resolved as a matter of urgency as it has been ongoing for nearly two months now.",1
"I am very pleased with the telephonic consultation / service I received from the DISCOVERY INSURANCE staff member namely MATHIBEDI CHUEU, who answered my call when I had phoned in on 15 November 2021 to request an immediate cancellation of my Discovery Insurance.

Despite the fact that I had called in with not good news, Mr Chueu was professionally very courteous in (1) listening to my call without interruption (2) asking me for the reasons why I was requesting a termination of my insurance (3) checking with me if I understood the full suite / portfolio of Discovery Insurance benefits that are available (4) eloquently explaining these benefits and what it takes to access them (5) asking me who is my new insurance company - I declined to disclose this (6) asking me how much in ZAR terms is the monthly premium and other key benefits I have been offered (7) trying to present the Discovery equivalent of the benefits from the new insurance company. Overall, Mr Chueu left me with the impression that Discovery Insurance does not take light when their clients want to terminate, they try hard to understand the reasons for the intended termination and try even harder to counter offer and to ensure that their clients are not unintentionally oblivious of the FULL basket of Discovery Insurance benefits. At the of our conversation, I made Mr Chueu understand that I had a compelling (affordability versus value) reason for having decided to terminate.",5

"Disappointing service on a claim that was approved but still awaiting a voucher...

The voucher was supposed to be issued for a replacement TV at MAKRO but been waiting forever for voucher issue. Called in several times to discovery with consultant saying voucher was issued and will be resent but I never ever get it!! Now the TV at MAKRO is even out of stock and next replacement costs R1000 more....

Can discovery just send me my voucher already and rectify what TV I can now get since it is out of stock!!! Very frustrating as this is my first claim and I'm not impressed at all!!!",1
"Best in the business! #discoverydidgood 

I had a very silly moment of not fueling up on my way to work as I thought I would save some time - this left me stuck on the side of the highway in peak morning traffic. I phoned **********and was assisted by the lovely Solofelang Mosiapoa from the Emergency Services department. Within 25 minutes I was back on the road and at work on time. 

I am grateful that this was nothing serious, but considering that this minor 'emergency' was dealt with so efficiently, I feel so safe knowing that in the worst case scenario, Discovery has my back! keep up the excellent work.",5

"My car insurance premium has just gone up 12.5%. Discovery have a long explanation, none of which I feel is applicable. I have made no claims, inflation is closer to 5%, the exchange rate actually improved over the period, and of course vehicles depreciate. On top of this, they are hiking the rate less than 12 months after I insured the vehicle. I complained and they just emailed back the same standard reasons which don’t add up. They seemed very keen to gain my business earlier this year and I thought I was a valuable customer – clearly not.",1
"Wow the service I received from discovery car insurance it was so excellent.I was involved in a car accident the 4th of October,the support I received from discovery team was just humbling from assisted with towing,car hire,updates from Boitshepo Baitsile from the penal beater.The people I spoke with on the phone where efficient and helpful.Wow I'm really amazed by such a great service,u deserve 10stars.Not forgetting Cameron Naidoo my financial advisor.Thank you discovery insurance I'm even recruiting family and friends because you are indeed the big insurer in the world",5

I have 2 claims 1st on 21 October 2021 and 2nd 15 Nov 2021 the never come back to tell me what is going on and I have to call every 2nd day and then this on thats deeling with is on leave and every time it is somebody else and this claims is going nowhere I AM REALLY SO DISIPOINTED THAT I MOVED TO DISOVERY WITH ALL MY POLICIES,1
My car went in for service less than 2 weeks ago and yesterday just died in the middle of the road. It would not start at all after several attempts. All this in the middle of a thunderstorm. I called Discovery Insure and was swiftly assisted by Zubaid Joseph. He ascertained that I was a woman alone in the car and immediately dispatched a security guard to ensure my safety while I waited for a tow truck to assist me. He called every few minutes to update me and made sure all was on track. He also gave me a courtesy call once I was home to make sure I was safe. This is what you call excellent service. Thank you #ZunaidJoseph and Discovery Insure,5
"My mother was held up at gun point in her flatlet a few weeks back, trying to get discovery to sort this out has been a nightmare.
Yesterday we received an email form Jane Legodi, the claims consultant, asking for proof of ownership, signed quotes and the best of all, the assessment report. Firstly, would you like us to courier you the owners manuals, power supply units and boxes for the  small electronics. As for the quotes, they have all been emailed to you, twice!
Then for the assessment report, would you like me to do my own report or are you going to appoint an assessor. If you are going to appoint someone, please do in a timeous manner. If not here is my report.
 My mother was held up and goods were stolen, Please see previously mentioned email for a list and attached quotes.
Maybe after receiving this you will be able to move our claim away from ""CLOSED"" status.

"Discovery insure always pulls through for me , I’m never disappointed when I’m in need of their assistance. Today I locked my keys in the boot by mistake and I called the emergency assistance line. What a pleasure to be assisted by Zunaid Joseph, he got me a lock smith and called to check on me through out . Even called to check if I go home safely , you don’t get better service than that. Thank you Zunaid , I really felt better after the day I had and it’s all thanks to you .",5
<div>Shafik Allow Department: Retentions rendered an excellent service. I can recommend Discovery insure to anybody</div>,5
Just received notice that my house and car insurance will increase in excess of 10%. Over R250 per month. How is that even allowed? When I asked for them to review and advice I was told that they cannot reduce the payment and still no reason for the huge increase. Guess I will be insurance shopping.,1
awesome experience and service from Tasmina Nair,5
Thank you for the excellent service by Ridwaan Ebrahim as an ABC I find that he is very professional and always goes out of his way to assist. Thank you!!!,5
"The second time I have a claim and they always have an excuse to not pay out the claim 
They are the worst, premiums only go up yet the value of my vehicle decreases and when you enquire they come with more lame excuses, I did the Tiger wheel and Tyre inspection check as per their requirements, yet still when you claim they will find an excuse.",1

"I have been insured with Discovery from 2016. 
The servicing and processing of claims has always been so great until recently .
I had an accident on the 02 November 2021 and the claim was registered on the 
3rd November 2021 and my claim was assigned to Tshepo Kekane.
The assessment of the car was only done on the 15 November 2021 and to date im still awaiting feedback on the assessment 
Im very dissatisfied with the lack of communication and delays from the claims department. When you call the call center the claim specialist assigned for the claim is either on  call or never at their desk and will never even return the call .  I have to constantly call and sent emails to them.   How long does it take an assessor to do an assessment on the car?",1
"So my DQ Stand-alone tracker has not sent a signal since the 12th Oct 2021… more than a MONTH ago.
NO message or check up from Discovery or the tracking company (c-track I think?).
We could be DEAD IN A DITCH, car in a chop shop and Discovery Insure would not even realize until the payment bounced! 
In fact that would probably be the only time they gave ****!

I’m furious. Why am I paying for a tracking service designed to protect my life and my vehicle when nobody even bothers to check why the vehicle is sending no signal?!!

Discovery Insure, how can you honestly tell me that you would know if my vehicle was stolen? If I was in trouble? If you needed to act?
I cannot trust this device anymore!
How can ANYONE trust this device?
Pathetic and shameful!

I expect the fees I’ve already paid for the tracker refunded and technician to be sent out TO ME to change the device to an actual reputable tracking company. 

A tracking company that might be interested in asking why the vehicle has been offline for a month… or maybe why the vehicle is now spending the night in a township instead of the garage of the registered overnight location? 

If you honestly think that I’ll believe that your tracking partner will suddenly care and monitor if I just let you repair the device, then you must think very little of your clients. Please don’t suggest it, you’ll insult me, nobody is that stupid.
I’d rather it be removed.

Looking forward to your response.",1
"Thank you Discovery Insure and assessor Riaan Whitney for handling our claim in a prompt and efficient manner. We lodged a claim, was contacted by Riaan and within a couple of days, our claim was finalized. Great assurance to know that your Insurer has your back when you need them.",5
"I recently had to claim for my broken windscreen. And I must say, the respect, professionalism and quick turnaround of Thembi Mahlangu was amazing. She insured that my car was well taken care of and that Glasfit got it done correctly. 

In these horrid times it's great to see that the service at Discovery Insure and it's super staff has not waned. Happy customer",5
Shafick Allow  provided excellent service!  Thank you Discovery Insure for great service.,5

Busi Taliwe Great efficient service with follow up,5
Thank you Ramotlou Dimakatso from the Discovery claims department you gave a fantastic service 👌👌👌,5
I had hail damage to my car and put a claim for same. Discovery insure found the repairs to be over the cost of my and decided to salvage my car. They informed of the decision and I decided not to proceed and go the private route and thus informed them. The next time i get a call that the salvage company was coming to collect my car and i call discovery and they tell me they forgot to cancel the salvage and update to say i'm proceeding privately. we settle that and I forward them quotes of the private company they approve and i sign the relevant papers and i thought claim was finalized and payment will be made. Two weeks later the claim handler didn't process the payment. I am 73 year old lady and had so much stress with this company and nonchalant behaviour from their claim handlers.,1
"#DiscoveryDidGood, fantastic service from Aretha Tobias",5
Super efficient and pleasant experience today to do 5 point check and install a tracking device at Discovery Drive centre in Cape Town. Nice to sit with a cup of coffee while it all happens in the background.  Consultant Yumna Rahman deserves top marks for great customer service!,5
A 5 star rating for Rekha Jackdave from the Retentions department - Her energy and service regardless of what time it is in the day is always top tier ! Always a pleasure to work with.,5
"For the first time in many years since I have been covered by Discovery for building insurance, I received an appalling service to say the least. I report a broken tap and leaking toilet. A service provider was appointed to come repair these as per norm on which the first hour of the callout fee is covered by the insurance excluding replacement parts. The service provider got to my home at 15H10 and left 18 minutes later. The informed us that their Job is to take pictures of the identified issues and compile a report for Discovery. I was puzzled by this statement as its not the first time I am using this service for my home emergency requirements. None the less the guys left. I decided to inquire with Discovery but the agent helping advised that she will enquire with the service provider. Only after I complained to Discovery then these guys want to explain to me what need to be replaced, on top of that they were just sitting in the car, possibly to make use of the full hour for doing absolutely nothing. They had a full hour to tell me what needs replacing and quoting me the necessary for after the complaint. And the agent assisting me wouldn’t hear any of it so I told them to leave as I rather give this job to a deserving provider who’s actually interested in the job at hand.",1
Fantastic and quick services. Insurance payment made quickly with many options. I am extremely happy with my Insurance. Thank you Mothokoa Mpya.,5
The lack of response from them is terrible and keep u holding for over 10 minutes and they don't come back to you.  And the person u dealing with on leave and does not have an out of office,1

"Thursday afternoon 13:43, 11 November 2021 we lodged a claim with Mzwakhe Radebe, claim # **********.  Emailing him with all the requirements that he requested from us.  There was no confirmation from Mzwakhe Radebe that he had indeed received the emails (just common decency).  Monday afternoon 13:30, 15 November 2021 my wife called discovery insure to follow up on our claim, speaking to Tobogo, only to find out that Mzwakhe Radebe had yet to attach the emails that was sent 4 days prior to our claim. NOTHING had been done.  Tobogo sent an (urgent) email to Mzwakhe Radebe asking him to please attach the relevant information to the claim so it can be processed.  My wife in turn also emailed Mzwakhe Radebe asking for confirmation of receipt for emails sent on Thursday 11 November 2021.  A day later and STILL no confirmation, STILL no call back from Tobogo...
The service received is pathetic to say the least.  I was under the impression that Discovery is one of the better insurers when it comes to staff training, customer service etc etc
If your staff don't want to do their jobs, replace them with people who will!
Can someone from Discovery insure please sort this out",1
"I am LIVID beyond words. Claim # ***

Last week, I asked Busisiwe to get  a manager to contact me. I asked 3 times per email. No response.

I spoke to several agents, including “Palesa “ who said Crest won’t fix my floor (15/11/2021 at 17.49)

The previous agent I spoke to at 14.19pm, however, said the cost of the floor repair was for Crest flooring, and that she’s advised them to amend the quote.

I called today at 8.11am, 8.22am, 8.26am, 9.42am, 9.55am and 10am . Each time I am put on hold for between 8 and 20 minutes with no resolution, call back, or manager/team leaders feedback.

Staff member Lesego call date 16/11/2021 at 10.08am refused to put me through to a team leader, says she cannot promise they will call me back or give me a time. She also refutes that that’s what’s she said. Kindly pull the call up. I’ve informed her I recorded the call as well. It took 9.13 sec to get the email address used here.

Is this how Discovery deals with clients ? In that case, return my flooring that you removed, and cancel my insurance policy. I will cancel my other policies too.",1
"Stanley at Discovery Insure was excellent! Within 24 hours of submitting my claim, he had responded, and put the paperwork through. Payment was in my account in less than 24 hours from when I submitted the claim.",5

"Efficiently dealt with request to assist my wife with her cars flat battery.
Their contracted service supplier responded promptly.
Discovery insure then followed up to check if our request had been seen too.",5
"I canceled my Discovery Insure policy because I could get a better price somewhere else. When I sent an Email asking if they could review my premiums, they said I was on the lowest rate they could offer. But when I phoned to cancel the policy they were all of a sudden prepared to lower my premiums - which were still higher, while insuring me for less. I specifically asked the lady I spoke to if I would get my Vitality Drive cashback and she assured me that I would, since I was still insured by Discovery until 31 October and I still paid for Vitality Drive for October. I put  in R1000 worth of petrol in October, which means I should get back R500. Cashback is paid between the 10th and the 15th. It is already the 16th and no cashback!",1
I was so happy with discovery insure the way the consultant Castello advised me regarding my car insurance and the patience he had for me because i had a lot of questions and uncer*****y about discovery. however I am super happy that i took the insurance,5
"I want my car papers back, after you have tried to write off my car and i cancelled that the claim and now why don't you want to give me my papers back, because you didn't even pay me any money to fix the car, please get my papers back ASAP i am tired of discovery i cannot believe you will give bad service to someone who has almost everything run by discovery what a bad service, i am disappointed Discovery.",1

Hi. I have logged numerous tickets. I have called. Tyger Whell Tyre have called. Still my Insure Sensor is not working after Discovery messed it up without my ask. Why is it not fixed? You are incompetent taking more than a week with no fix or support. Pathetic,1
