"This bank is something else. I trusted them with my money and they cannot help with fraud transactions made into my account Via Uber,they are telling me it’s not fraud…*** any money that moves from my account without my authority is fraud to me. The money went out in the 23rd and the statement I got from them said 24th,which ****** bank gets dates wrong. They then ask me to do an investigation with Uber eats. Uber eats doesn’t recognise 3 of the transactions there, howwww if they reflect on my account and statement? I know other banks confirm such things especially more than 2 transactions going through to the same company, before proceeding with the princess 3rd or fourth transactions,this stupid bank went and let 4 transactions go through R1700 on uber eats. Mind you all their texts were delayed,these transactions were made around 18:00 I got a notification at 20:00,the last 1 I got at 22:00 and this payment was made at 19:00. Had I had received this earlier I would have stopped the card ASAP. I blocked the card and went to get a new card,when I tried to buy with the card it was not active,I go back to the branch and to see what was the matter,they couldn’t figure it out!!My card would be sorted in 72 hours,I have a fuggin child that needed food!!
!I then send money so I can collect at Shoprite…This was at 15:30 it’s 03:42 now I still haven’t received that text with pin and ref number.You are so incompetent it’s ridiculous, I want my money back,that money is insured,investigate as much as you want,but I want my money back. I need answers, I’d rather go bank into paying those FNB charges than being told unknown transactions aren’t fraud.",1
"Hi guys 

I just want to make a follow up in regards to the settlement offer I was advised of 
May you kindly contact me on ********** so I can hear the offers available.",5
"Not very helpful, would not recommend.",1
"On shoprite/checkers Voucher I received from African Bank of R150 I only spend R100 then the next tried to spend the remaining  R50 using same Wicode but declined , what happened to the R50?",3
"This is the last month ""If you don't want to get stressed, Please don't open an African Bank account!!!! My credit card had fraudulent activities on it, I logged request for investigation the matter was not resolve, then I requested for a new card since the matter was not resolve so I can continue using the credit card, 3 weeks without any help from consultants. I went to 3 branches... Made phone calls.. No help"" Guess what??? Even now the matter is still not resolved!!",1
"I went to an African bank branch. I informed the consultant I would like to close my investment account. And I further gave them updated banking details for them to forward the amount remaining. The branch consultant said he can't help but will investigate the matter.why can't he help? because I once withdraw from my account. But promised the matter will be sorted.

With no response from the branch for over 5days I decided to contact them on tweeter. I clearly stated my problem and I was told to expect a call. I received a call which asked me to verify my personal information. I told the agent my id number and full name. Then I was asked the company contact numberI used to work for which I registered when opening the account. I mentioned the company and I mentioned that I haven't been working for the company for over 5years and I don't know there number. The consultant said she can't help me. So now it means I will never get my money. African bank keeps proving how stupid and incompetent they are I am so angry.",1
"Feedback after complaint log or rather lack thereof.  It all started with credit card application which was approved in Jan 2022.  Delivery of card done at work address.  NOBODY informed me that I will have to go to a branch (which are 200km from me) to activate card.  After telephone attempt to active card, I was informed to go to a branch.  On 24 Jan 2022 went to branch and informed that the card was cancelled because it was not activated in time.  Did a branch application again, card was issued and then apparently could not get hold of me to do security verification.  Again 2nd card was cancelled.  Third time, I applied on app, received the contract and after 2 days a sms informing transaction declined.  When I phoned in, the reason provided was that they could not confirm employment - NONSENSE!  How was it done the previous 2 times?  Complaint ref nr provided with sms on 11 Feb 2022.  Will take 7 business days to investigate.  Numerous times I received a call on cellphone which ranged once and then dead or if I picked up, no one on other side.  Phoned back and asked that they please make note that if not reachable on cellphone to phone landline.  Today I followed up again and the gentleman informed me that the complaints was closed, as they could not reach me.  I asked what the outcome was for my complaint and again the reason could not reach me.  This is not feedback on my original complaint and nobody phoned landline.  He informed me if I am not happy with the outcome, I can log a complaint with Ombudsman.  Insisted to speak to supervisor.  Again I had to tell the whole reason for my complaint and again provided my landline nr.  She informed me she will logged another complaint.  Again have to wait 7 business days?  No No No!  Insisted that they call me before 17h00 today.  Needless to say.........no call.",1
"Applied for a loan a few days ago. I don't know how these people work. The day I applied the called me so quickly to do the application. I asked to think about the offer, they knew how to follow up. After I accepted, they just went quiet.. No follow up or even a sms to advise if my application was successful or not. I requested call back and till today no call has been returned. Such unprofessionalism makes me understand why people say this is the worst bank.",1
We paid my husband's credit card settlement amount and the credit card is still op. We have yet someone to contact us or send him a settlement letter,1
"Actually the dont deserve even that 1 star. They decided to update their app and when they were done i am unable to log in. Keeps saying please check details entered. Deleted the app and downloaded another one but still, then decided to go to a branch where i left happy cz i could access online banking but it worked for few days  and went offline as well. Not have no access to my money i dont have money to go to work. I Visited their Fb page and they promised to call me which they said they tried but never did my fone was never off and then getting an sms saying "" unfortunately you have locked your pin"" giving me steps to reset my pin. The very same pin i last used on the online banking on Sunday Midday and on the app i last used it before their stupid upgrade. Now i want to know who locked the pin??????   And how was it locked because the last time i used it it worked perfectly..

Visited the website to reset thinking it will work. I have been waiting for the otp it almost an hour now.  this is not fair at all!!!!!!!",1
"Since 2016 I've been using African.. Borrowing money..
Everything is perfect.. You know what you pay for   
Thank you African Bank.. 
Tembisa, Kempton park and East gate mall.. You the best",5
"I Being charged when the credit card declined, when I have money, this is no longer funny, I cannot be humiliated all the time I am using this Credit card, and when I complain here u tell me that I must call your call centre no, where the consultants drops the call immediately when rhey hear that I am complaining about the fees that I am charged wn my card is declining, for the last time resolve this issue and refund me the money that I have been charged from last year,

"My dad made a loan of R15 570, 13/12/2007 the loan was suppose to have been paid up 01/12/2010 with an installment that they paid of R793.69 month while my dad was still working which they did pay until my dad could not work anymore then short payments was made but my mom still made payment maybe less but she still paid to date they have paid R28 721 which according to African Bank they still outstanding with R4145.58. Which tells me my mom has paid this loan long time finish with interest so why are they still outstanding. And what African Bank did now is they started debting their Standard Bank account which does not have money in and interest is being put on the account the amount of R793.69 for a pensioner?? I am not leaving this matter as is next will be a email to the ombudsman I Denise Adams has gotten power of attorney on all my dad's affairs his Mr John Charles Petersen  account nr **********. And before calling me make sure of your facts and look on your system.",1
Please explain to me when I dont call I will get 5-6 calls per day wanting your money but when I complained I was told 48 hours that was in January and im still waiting for an expalaination why do I contribute R500 on banking fees amd R120 on the actual amount borrowed. So must I chase after all to explain this to be me a whole 3 weeks no feedback can I get an explaination I would love to get rid of your guys your service is disgusting to say the least,1
"I am extremely ****ed off with the incompetent service provided by African Bank, their staff is rude and incompetent. I didn't even place a refund request prior to today and it's reflecting on their system",1
After claimed the reward I didn't receive the sms with voucher till now,1
"After my report of 16-02-2022 regarding their app problem and no response to my emails, I had a call from a woman on the 17th Feb. I asked why they did not answer my emails to which she replied that she does not have any. I asked if it was because of my report on Hello Peter to which she said yes.
I told her what had happened when I refused to accept their wanting free access to my phone and all data on it. She then said I could decline and still download the app. I advised her that you could not do that. She took down my email address and said she would check inti it and come back to me.  NO WORD YET!!!
How can a person that is asking to to assist you not even know what is going on with their systems?
As I said before, want a job and then sit and wait to get pay at the end of the month.",1
"Since I reported my case when I lost my money at african bank Ghandi Square in the 19/01/2022. I submitted all the documents they wanted from me, the lady called Hlezi Mathebula. She was collection all the information from. On our conversation I did ask her to show me CCTV camera,she say they don't have it at the shop because they're working with money and their policy said so.

I was surprised. She called on the 26/01 and told me that the forensic department will do an investigation and they will call and tell me about their findings. Until today I haven't received a call and that lady sent me an email saying..."" the matter was resolved"" of which she was lying nothing was resolved.",4
"USELESS< I complained about their call centre on the 11th , I received a call form a ""Very concerned lady "" who promised they would remove our details from their database , speak to the agent. Well guess what. NADA, NIX nothing.That did not happen. I should have expected as much. LIAR's We have just received a call looking for my former colleague. USELESS",1
Went to change my contact numbers yesterday. I was assisted by a very professional lady. I didn't pay attention to getting her name cause I was with a 5 year old who I had to constantly check on,5
"My 24months investment has matured but there's no transfer method 
I've  been trying with no luck",1
"I've been sending emails trying to make calls to get a meer settlement quote! It's such a pain in the neck. It's not the first time I'm trying to settle this very account and the last time I did this very thing happened. It's beyond frustrating. All I want is to settle my account, why am I not getting any assistance with the matter!!",1
"Absolutely ****** useless!!!!
They updated their app but before you can use it there are a number of things that you have to agree too. 
Here is some of the things you have to agree too:
Allow African Bank to manage and make calls.
Allow access to your location.
Allow access to photos, media and files on your phone.
Now I have sent them 4 emails to the email address they supplied on an SMS  insisting on an explanation. I received one ""read report"" so they did get it but are not attending to my query. 
Everybody wants a job but then they want to sit and do nothing, except get their big salary at the end of the month.
They should not even get a one star rating.
NO SERVICE!!!!!",1
Today marks 16 days I didn't receive reward for swiping 10 times,1
"African Bank made changes to its apps over the weekend. Since then I have been unable to access Mobile Banking or Internet Banking. I have uninstalled and reinstalled, reset passwords, pins, etc, called the Helpdesk, and am still unable to access my money. I just got an SMS advising that I should visit my nearest branch. I don't have time for this. Why should I be inconvenienced because African Bank stuffed up? Please fix your mess and help your loyal customers to access their accounts without the inconvenience of having to go into a Branch. I did not cause this!",1
"Good morning 

Part of the negotiation of Settling my African bank account was that they would close my account and fix my payment profile with the credit bureas,  it's been close to a month since I paid very close to hundred thousand rand to settle my account, my account shows closed with Transunion and Experian but the profile has not been fixed, please assist me with this as every time I email to ask it's a different person handling my case, I have sent my credit reports twice now for assistance",1
"I applied for a loan on the 10th - been in review ever since, no calls, no feedback.
How long does this process take? Emailed all my docs the same day.
Uploaded all proof. Nobody called me today...dont know what is happening? Loaded the app - still says in review since 10/02/2022.",1
They help me efficiently and I am satisfied.,4
Today i went into African bank due to the fact I could not get on my banking nor swipe my card. On arriving the branch was offline and there phones were down so I had to call the client services from my cell phone while I sat in front of the consultant. The branch manager was not available and then on top of it all the guy I spoke to on the phone wanted me to remember an amount I purchased last on airtime as a security question. I was also told that i received a MSG telling me to uninstall the app and then reload but I never got it and showed the consultant that I never got it only received it over 4 hours after being there. So I have to do the branch consultants work and then while sitting in front of them with my ID and card the bank still refuses to accept its me because of a stupid question of which I did answer correctly but took to long. Congratulation African Bank on a pathetic work performance and the cost of a client.,1
"I have lost R18900 on my world account due to card cloning and African bank failed to pay it back, even though they realized that it was withdrawn while my card was in my pocket",1
"Good day All. 
I have applied for a loan on Thursday by African Bank, and normally the money will reflect in my bank account the very next day. It is Sunday for Pete sake and no reflection of the money in my account shows. That I call bad services. However the gentleman who helped was very friendly and I will recommend everybody to him for help. 
African Bank how long must I still wait or must I take my business somewhere else.",1
Call centre will not update their details,1
"I had accounts with African bank between 2012 and 2013, which were last paid in 2013. I did not hear from you between 2014 and 2019 or so, and I tried getting in touch in 2018 to inform you that these debts have prescribed and you must please remove these. Instead you started debiting my account and those payments were never honoured, as the accounts were prescribed. My banking details had never changed but you never debited my account for over 3yeara nor communicated with me. Last year 2021 I got calls every day and I informed the collections people that the accounts they were calling about long prescribed and they kept quoting the debits thats were never honoured, that I paid .... Subsequently two of these accounts were closed in Dec and I have received the prescription letters , only one is left now ans I don't know why because the case is the same and I am still getting calls. Please close this account and update my profile please and send me the letter so I can do it myself if you cannot. 

Regards 
Sekelwa",1
"I’m not happy with African bank. My card is on hold and I don’t know why. I have been calling since Sunday and still no help as I’m supposed to wait for a call. It doesn’t make sense for my account to be on hold while I’m the one who sends myself money. This is unacceptable. I cannot buy food or anything and still no valid reason as to why I’m waiting. 5 days without knowing why my card is on hold ?
I wouldn’t recommend this bank to anyone.",1
"Since June 2021, my accounts and profile are blocked and there is money which has not been used ever since. I have been paying a loan which is now paid up, but deductions are still being done. My local African bank has not helped, as I was sent back and forth and they said it's a system problem. Asna assisted me at the local branch, numerous times, to try and unblock my profile and the accounts, without success. She contacted head office more than 5 different times to no avail. I cannot believe that it is Feb 2022, and I still can't acces my money. This is worse than Daylight robbery!",1
"I swiped more than 10 times in January for more than R50 per purchase, so why I'm not getting any reward",2
"I have been an African bank customer for years , I have paid my account as required and have not been in arrears
-	I recently requested another personal loan and the aim of that was for me to reduce the larger loan I had 
-	I called in and I was given an estimated amount that I had to pay to reduce my instalment which I did      
-	I was not happy with the reduced instillment but could not complain as I was advised it was an estimate  
-	I  paid a further R 5000 on to my personal loan  and requested that the instalment be reviewed again  
-	I was advised that this was not possible as my account was already reviewed  , I than requested that I be refunded the R5000 back which I was 
-	Now I am advised that my account is in arrears for R 3000+ because I requested a refund , African tried to explain how the arrears came to be however this does not make sense 
-	I did not skip my monthly repayments as this is debi check  I  paid an additional lump sum of money the very some month however my account is in arrears 
-	The fix from African bank is to include the R3000 in to my loan and increase the very same instalment I was trying to reduce 

I have followed African  banks in house complaints process and all they could say is sorry we can not help you go to the Ombudsman  Cell Number **********",1
I applied for a loan through the African bank app on my phone on the 7th. I submitted all the required documents but I keep on getting an sms that says I must submit confirmation of employment and I did 2 times already but I still get the same responce. I called yeasterday to find out how far my application is and I was told it is already with the team that needs make the payment and that takes a maximum of 48 hours for the payments to be made. By the look of things I wont be getting any payment soon because I keep on getting the same request of submitting the confirmation of employment which I did a number of times. When we apply for these loans that means we have emergencies and now this back and forth of requesting the same document is really delaying me. I am not even a new client and all my payments are up to date and this is really disappointing. How long should I wait while my emergency is still standing.,1
I just had a consultant call me RE my enquiry on a credit card application. Apart from rambling on sounding so bored and saying everything so fast that I couldn't hear what she was saying - she asked for my capitec account number - I asked why and she said if I'm not comfortable I must go into the bank. I said no - I am asking you why you would need my capitec account number and she hung up on me.,1
"Forensic blocked my online APP and I have been told to visit the branch, I have done so and Branch couldn’t resolve the issue still don’t have access to my APP. How many times do I have to take my time and go to the branch for African bank to unblock my APP? African Bank do not care about their customers",1
"Good Day

I' am truly frustrated  with African bank,I settled my debt in 2020 March to both African bank   and the account that was handed over.I tried applying for a loan and the rejection reason is that I still owe AB legal...what exactly am I owing
This is the second year I'm trying to have this sorted out  and   I do not  know why they   cant update  their   legal   department that the   account  is paid in full

"I received a settlement discount from African Bank on 28/01/2022 and paid up my load account on 29/01/2022 at Maponya Mall branch. Whilst making the cash deposit at their ATM facility, a certain amount of the deposit that went into the machine did not reflect on the statement under the funds received. I was advised by the consultant that the machine may be full and might not be able to read some of the notes, but this should not be a problem as Fedility collections will run an audit and the funds will be traced and updated.

A log request was created for these outstanding funds with log no. ********** on site with Mxolisi. An sms log updated was received whist at the branch and I was informed that further updates would be received in 48hrs.

7 days later on 07/02/2022 I had to followup with African Bank Maponya Mall branch (Spoke to Mxolisi) as no updates had been received. He advised that he will follow up on the log via email for an update. I was not please with his response, he then advised me to call the branch on ********** to do a follow up.  In frustration I did that follow up with the branch and was advised that an update had been placed on the system on 29/01/2022 @ 16h02 by C Taya, that documents have been requested from African Bank Maponya Mall by the finance department in order to proceed with the log. Immediately I called African Bank Maponya mall, spoke to Mxolisi once again and advised him of the feedback received from the branch.

On 08/02/2022 I called African Bank Maponya mall to follow up on the progress made after yesterdays interaction with them. I spoke to Lerato who advised that she could not assist in Mxolisi's absence, I then requested to speak to management. 

Whilst holding for management my call was put down, when calling back  in 2 seconds, I was told that Lerato was on another call.

I was then assisted by Austin Mudau the branch manager, I explained my situation to him and again I did not get the assistance I needed. Instead I was told that a follow up email will be sent to the department.

I am totally not happy with the service I have received from African Bank Maponya mall instead, Im told that in order to get assistance I need to go to the branch. 

I the customer, having to resolve internal African Bank issues, this shows a low work ethic from your employees and should be addressed immediately.

I would appreciate you urgent resolution in resolving my case.",1
I am lost for words. I have been paying my loan and credit card and in December settled both accounts. I called in to confirm my accounts have since been closed and was told my credit card has been but not the loan. I asked why and the agent said after I paid charges were added and I now need to pay this amount. I had requested a settlement letter which gave me an amount that I paid and to no surprise they trying to extort more money from me! How can a bank of this size continue ripping off consumers especially in these trying times? I want this resolved asap. I have paid way too much and it’s not fair to now expect me to still pay more. Absolutely absurd!,1
There is noting i regret taking a credit facility with African bank your service is so bad the last week of January I calles in to ask why are my banking fees R500 and I only contribute R120 to the actual amount I get that im in errors and there is fees but how come from a debit order of R660 I only pay R120 and rest gos to banking fees it means it will take me years to pay up. I asked this matter to escalated and advised I changes my numbers and gave the correct ones because I dont have the time to go update at the branch I was told it will take 48 hours for a response its is the second week of Feb and still no response. Your service is bad to the core I dont know how many times iv written a review about your company can this matter be sorted I want answers why am I charged so much on the banking fees my Ref is ********** and please reach out on the numbers made on the  notes i want answers and invest in your service.,1
"No one at African Bank can assist you with the correct answer you get told to hold on while the discuss the matter with a supervisor for more that 11minutes and then you get cur off when you phone again you have have to explain the entire situation again and worst of all is no other institution is willing to assist you if you bank with African Bank. The only thing I require is a straight forward answer from someone that knows what they are talking about and to supply me with a solution to my problem. I chose African Bank as my bank to bank with and my salary gets paid into this account i am starting to think this was the worst decision of my life,",1
"If you don't want to get stressed, Please don't open an African Bank account!!!! My credit card had fraudulent activities on it, I logged request for investigation the matter was not resolve, then I requested for a new card since the matter was not resolve so I can continue using the credit card, 3 weeks without any help from consultants. I went to 3 branches... Made phone calls.. No help",1
"In 2020 i did an insurance claim for unpaid leave in lock down, it was paid for and African bank did not reset my debit order for the next month , thus resulting no debit going off.. I queried this and no feedback was received and i said to them how do they expect me to just pay this full amount  when it was not my fault the debit was not reset.. In Jan my normal debit went off plus they debited another amount with out my consent which i think is very wrong!!! Who gives you the right to just take money without making prior arrangements.. VERY ANNOYED CUSTOMER",1
"For the past 4 months, I have been struggling to put in withdrawals on my account to gather some funds. I keep on getting an error message that I need to call customer service to help me which I do but still to no solution. They keep on saying IT needs to look at my account and figure out what the block is... It has been 4 months and I still cannot put in a partial withdrawal as well as NO ONE is getting back to me... 
Is this a ploy of them to keep your investments without you being able to access the funds... 
I am highly concerned about their business ethic and would like to warn everyone out there.",1
"False advertising about a loan application taking 1 to 2 days. False advertising about friendly and efficient service. Their call Centre mumber is never answered. They don't reply to emails. Or they reply telling your phone was engaged when the phone notifies of am incoming call.
Customer service will call you just to tell you they can't help you then the agent will eventually hang up on you.
I received a contract for a loan on 02 Feb but it stil hasn't paid.
They claim to have escalated my case to loans department 4 times. They have lied about the stage where my application is at several times. I was even told that the eft was done which was also a lie. The loans department apparently has no phones so they can't be contacted, it's a matter of waiting for them to reply email
Even the social team will call and apologize but still lie because they still knocked off yesterday with no answers or conclusion or solution to my issue.
I am not impressed with the service  at all. There is no effort to resolve the case and honor what is promised to the customer.  No effort to find out where the hold up is and resolve the matter. Very unprofessional. This culture at African Bank of not having answers for the customer is nonsense!",1
"Just wasted R 12,00 Airtime Calling African Bank on **********, not even a Prompt to have them Call Me Back when the Consultant Finally Answered and a few minutes into the Conversation My Airtime ran Out and the Consultant could have Called Me back because they did pull up my Profile but that's African Bank Customer Service for You.",1
I've been having a loan with African Bank since 2017 got stuck can't pay it but the loan still is not getting prescribed as the prescription act says a minimum of 3 years without payment I hardly can't afford to feed my kids what more with them it's almost the sixth year n don't remember when last I afforded to pay I'm humbly requesting them to prescribe the debt .,1
My problem is still not solved my account is still on hold since last year! I just want to close the account up i can't access to my money they have been sending me to capetic but im using their bank and they are the ones who put my account on hold i have been explaining to them that i got the site link on Facebook 😏we weee in groups so the main admin that introduced us to this is no longer the site is no longer functioning so were do u want me to get the proof of payment i just want that account closed i had a very bad experience with this bank i wouldmt even consider my family to use this bank😑!!!!!,1
"Good day.I have received calls from African Bank with regards to outstanding debt of a Mr Leon Geyer.It was explained to your staff that i am not this person and that they should remove my cellphone number from your data base.Your staff have opted NOT to do that and persist in calling me.This is a FINAL NOTICE to African Bank to remove my number**********)from your system and that i am NOT Mr Leon Geyer.

From Mrs Victor",1
"African Bank thinks it is ok to robocall a business asking the recipient to hold on the line and wait for their consultant?!?

The call wasn't even related to the business but for a member of staff!",1
"This morning I received a call from Marcia Siganunu regarding my overdue premiums on my loan account. I explained to her that I was not working at the moment - something that African Bank has been aware of. She then proceeded to prod me asking me if I don't have a provident fund to pay for the loan. This after I had already explained that I have no current income. I have had a few phone calls from African Bank before. I have never experienced such rude, degrading and disgusting treatment from someone who works with people.",1
Once again you have proven to be my saving grace!! My own bank would not do for me what you have done. I will spread the word to everyone. African Bank is the bank to bank with.....,5
"ACCOUNTS:

I have a standing arrangement with African Bank to pay MY  account NEVER EVER have I paid late late since I signed that document.  NOW They send me a **** LEGAL NOTICE LETTER ?

I have sent numerous letters to them to do a name change NO RESPONSE 

I want them to explain to me why they are doing this.

AND on my Credit Profile there is a negative result for paying late whilst my payments is on time each and every month",1
Made payment arrangements with them. Suddenly they just double debit my account. This month they debited my account 3 times. Flippen frustrated,1
have a case where by I was offered a credit cad from African Bank. Before I received my card I got a call from Sibosiso Mdlalose at African Bank He claimed and asked me to go and collect my card from African Bank. I then later received a call from the same Sibosiso claiming to be calling from confirmation department to activate my monthly debit ode on a credit card. To my surprise He had the card no and some part of the back card no and the amount offered all the info was genue until He offered me a barring code to dial on my phone. I then suspected fraud and called the bank for assistance. I was advised that the card will be put on hold status and I can activate again by either an app or going to the branch. The consultant did everything to help at the bank 100%. But the card remained on lost status and couldn't issue a card. He was promise tobe called back until I called the call center again n He was advised to log a call. I was then give a turn a round time of 48hrs my question is why do I have to wait so long after I was told it can resolved immediately and this is not the 1st time I'm experiencing bad service from African Bank.,1
"Bank accounts have been opened up in my name without my permission, after querying this at the branch, the consultant confirmed this and advised I go to the Police and do an affidavit and submit tp their *********** email. Which I did, to where I got a reply someone has been trying to call me, which is utter nonsense as their was no missed calls on my phone. I sent another email which only go their auto responder emails. After wasting time trying to get through to their call center, I don't know why the Bank just does not close the accounts. Affidavit needed, they have it. Seriously.",1
I have not once but twice now qualified for rewards with African Bank I've redeemed both times sms should have been sent to me notifying me that I have received my rewards but nothing sent a complaint to their customer service explained to them my problem they requested my contact info which I have given an still nothing very disappointed as I do bank with African Bank why run a rewards program if they have no intent on giving their customers rewards it's false advertising,1
How long does an instant payment take to reflect? It's been a hour and I have yet to see my payment reflect. 😳,1
"I applied for a credit card and I was told my application was approved, my credit agreement was sent via email and I accepted the offer and T&C , and I was told to go and fetch my card at any African bank as of today. After a few minutes my credit was rejected saying I am listed on SAFPS - when I applied for this credit card I have provided you with a letter from SAFPS for validations so that you can approve my credit, someone was ignorant and did not validated with SAFPS that is why my credit application was rejected. I will NOT start all over again, I want you to urgently validate with SAFPS and approve my credit application immediately.",1
"Very bad service, and no feedback! Ive applied for a credit card for the second time now with african bank. 
The second time i went to the branch at centurion mall on the 28th of january, i was pre approved and the cards where given to me, all my details captured. Since then it has been a downhill battle of smses, emails and calls with missing documents. After uploading them now yet again for the how many time. Still no feedback and get the same sms again and again 

Please see below email and advise accordingly because this is now becoming a real pain just trying to open a credit card.

Ive uploaded all my documents more than 30 times now, to all available platforms that i can access.

"Good day 

I have been struggling to get a refund from African Bank after they over debited my account, I made a payment arrangement and for some reason, they over debited for the month of January 2022.  I then called the call center and was told the refund will be processed in 72hour and I received a sms confirmation stating so with reference number **********.  I then received a call and was told due to my phone not getting pop-up messages to accept some authentification messages I must go to the branch.  I then went to the branch yesterday (1/02/2022) and explained that I was sent by the consultant that called to finalize the refund.  The lady at the branch then called the call center and they hung up on the first call, we called again and the second consultant was just unhelpful.  She advised that I need to update my details online which I do not understand because I was at the branch with my ID and POR and none of my details have changed, if they required me to re-FICA why could it not be done at the branch?  None of the call center agents or people at the branch seem to know their job because I wasted air time calling and my time going to the branch in Balfour mall.  Can someone just let me know what needs to be done for my refund to be processed!!!!",1
"My experience with African bank...I don't even know where to begin. I've have been complaining about the same thing for the past three weeks. It's almost a month now since I've paid up my loan at African bank but their consultants keep on giving me empty promises when I asked for a paid up Lee three weeks ago. I was told by one of the  consultants that it takes 3 DAYS to get that paid up letter, but to my surprise I found myself calling African Bank every week  for the past 3 weeks asking for that paid up letter. Till this day I haven't received that letter. I hope this review will not fall on deaf ears. All I want a my paid up letter because I have paid off the loan how long must I wait 3 months maybe?",1
"The group opened a stokvel account with African bank on the 13th of December 2021. We were told that one user is needed to be the primary user before a pocket account could be opened. Since that time, I have never found any joy dealing with African bank.
To cut this story short, members contributed monies towards the pocket account, and we are supposed to make deposits to 2 members every month. Today was a due date for payments and unfortunately, we couldn’t succeed because African bank decided to flag my account status as suspected fraud and i was told i need to wait 72 hours before they can resolve the issue.

People are furious about their money and i am sitting here like a liar because this bank decided to inconvenience everyone of. I visited the Cape Gate and Mowbray branches, but I didn't get any help. People had plans and budgeted with this money, but they have been unable to do anything with it. This needs to be resolved asap and after this whole saga I’m closing this account and will never ever recommend this bank to anyone.

"What's the point of you guys sending a message to reedem and not send the message with the y-code after redeeming? You guys like it when we call every second asking for the code, yet your service is very poor!!! How much airtime should 1 use for R150 voucher?!!?? Aii man you guys are failing in this rewards thing!!!!",1
"I have no idea if you've changed the communication team or you no longer interested in your customers.

The whole day I spoke with your facebook team to no answer, called your called your call center and spend +R80 on airtime, requested to Chat on your website to no answer i even requested a call back.

i used to give high praises to your bank and brag about it to everyone to join you but now I'm losing trust in you and considering taking my business somewhere. if you're having high call volumes then communicating so that we know instead of just wasting my airtime.",1
I opened a new account called My World and me and wife EFTed money to activate it. 3 weeks later money still not reflecting and have been send around like crazy. I have been to talking to their call centre staff because I went to their Brooklyn branch and was told that they were offline and couldn't be helped. I have sent them proofs of payment more than once. Its the 1st of February 2022 and still no resolve. First deposit was made on 06/Jan and second on 17/Jan/2022. What a shambolic experience....,1
"I have applied for a loan and keep getting messages saying u need to send a clear copy of payslip which I have done then they said we will get back to u with a final offer I am still waiting no matter how I send it I get the same message

"I have applied for limit increase, the consultants at African bank are giving me tough time, they are sending me from post to pillar. My application was approved and i was told that the money was transferred and will appear within 48 hours..... it is almost three days now. the service at African Bank is very poor.",1
I have been harassed by African Bank regarding a missed payment. My contractual agreement confirms I get paid on the 1ast day of every month. African Bank then changed my date to the 25th without my consent or acknowledgement then proceeded to call me about the payment that was missed. I have since spoken to 3 agents informing them the changes to my account was done fraudulently and is against the Poppi act to protect my personal information. They person I spoke to Sylvester Foster told me this was a technical issue which I informed him is clearly a lie and a cover up for the act of fraud. If the was a technical issue within African Bank that puts my details at risk they were meant to inform me which didn't happen. He then told me he would need to send my complaint in writing to me so that I could take it further to report it to the ombudsmans. I have still not received anything.,1
"I am still awaiting response it been 2 weeks  , as African bank disclose my details and therefore I was fired. 
So if I called African bank.and ask them does Patrick Mostepe bank there and what are his details they will give it to me with a smile and print it out...

 I want to be compensated as I am jobless and soon to be homeless

 Please advise and conclude now today

"Hi I swiped my card at a store(for R51.98) last Thursday (27/01/2022). The card machine said transaction failed due to ""system mal****ion"". I then paid with my other Tymebank card which worked and went home. The next day I noticed the transaction had also went off on my African Bank card. So I had been double charged for the goods. I broght the matter to the awareness of the store. They said I should also make you aware. Why is their no feature to dispute a transaction on the app ? I have to choice but to approach you via Hello Peter over this incident.",2

"I still have no resolution as to why African Bank cannot add SARS as a beneficiary on their site.
I have been querying this issue since September 2020. I eventually contacted SARS and they told me no application has been made by African Bank in this regard, even though the bank has told me that it remains a long ongoing process.
This is extremely frustrating, since I still cannot pay my taxes through my own bank!

Please can someone contact me if there are any developments on this @ **********.",1
"I have been struggling for weeks to get through to the department who can assist in changing my debit order date.

I have called numerous times I never get assisted by an agent as the call never gets routed to a consultant.

I have used the sms call back service still the same thing a consultant transfers me to a department  where I just listen to a ivr.
I have changed jobs and I now get paid on the last day of the month no longer the 25th. I went to a African Bank branch guess what they advised me to do...call the same number.
 
Their service sucks they have no regard for their clients and their time, what's even funnier is that I want to pay my installment on time but they making it difficult. This will negatively affect my credit score which I've been working towards improving and I'll pay bank charges. Very unprofessional.",1
"So I requested a settlement quote on the chat box and settled my account . Decided to call today as I received no feedback or anything to obtain my paid up letter, so early 8h30 spoke to Siphiwe and client service whom after providing with my details he just said this account is handed over and transferred my call giving me no chance to even ask what he meant, I was wrongly transferred to Debt Review department where I was assisted by Precious and she was also surprised why was I transferred to her space. She then advises that I need to call tomorrow to get my paid up letter. Why must I keep calling for my paid up letter? I do not have time to be calling unprofessional agents who don't know what to do so early to transfer me to incorrect department. All I need is my paid up letter.",1
"My father who’s now a pensioner had a loan with you and took insurance of which was supposed to pay up the loan should he retire or unforeseen events take place. He’s  now retired and was advised to send all required documents of which was done but the issue is still not resolved as African bank still calls him saying he should settle outstanding amount.

We’ve been to the bank various times and we can’t get assistance, this is pathetic customer service and my dads health is deteriorating due to this . I’m fed up!!",1
"I borrowed money from this Bank December I settled both Loan and Credit Card on the 7 December but on the 23 they further deducted from my Bank account.  They requested proof of payments and send to them but still this month they have deducted 2 installments, when I spoke to them they say they have rectified this problem. The worse part is that when I go to my bank and reverse it charges R45 per reversal.  When the amount settled they use one account number and they different references but monies were paid and settled. Kindly help me I am tired of this Bank and people attending me are very rude.",1
"My husband applied for a loan.  He has been with african bank for quite some time now. He did an online application and went to the bank for the loan.

THERE WAS FRAUD ON MY ACCOUNT AND THEY CANT DO ANYTHING. I trusted your bank with my money but you let someone take it without caring. I only had the account for a year. An amount of 1399 went off my account. I didn’t buy anything online but was told it’s an online purchase. You normally get a pop up request to approve the purchase but I didn’t get that. When I called they told me they will reverse it. Then sent me a message saying they can’t reverse it I need to call Microsoft.,1

"On the 19th January 2022. I went to Absa Kruis street in Johannesburg to withdraw R7000 .00 it was around 15:15 at the time of this transaction inside Absa Branch. Immediately after withdrawing  this money inside Absa Kruis street. I walked to African bank Ghandi square as it's few minutes walk to go and settle my Africa bank credit card holding my R7000.00 cash that I withdrew from Absa inside my left pocket of my navy blue nurses pocketed uniform as I was from work, and safe to hold anything worthy of being kept safe.

I walked into african bank Ghandi square still having my money inside my left pocket. And when I got inside the bank I felt safe and relaxed to take out my hand from the pocket. I was told to seat down for assistance by a male consultant and I was the only client inside the bank. The consultant asked me to move from the desk to the other to make a call and I did not even think that anything can happen that I would involve my money getting lost.

I continued to make a call to ask for my settlement amount and after making a call I was directed by the same consultant to go deposit the money, however ,I was surprised when I put my hand into the pocket that my money was not there.

I couldn't think as I was confused and everything because the consultant and his collegue told me to go back to Absa to check if I don't loose my money there.

I instantly rushed to Absa and the Absa manager showed me the camera and I saw myself walking out of Absa with my money.

Nothing out of the ordinary happened on my way to African bank, however looking back I realised that my money felt out inside African Bank as it was wrapped in a plastic bag, and now the African bank's two staff members who were on the front would have now confused,me to go out so that they could hide that money.

I know they saw it falling from my pocket as I was the only client during all these and when I asked them to take me to cameras they said they don't have cameras. Pls help",1
"I have a problem with African Bank! I have phoned in on 30 Nov 2021 and asked a settlement amount on my loan. The lady gave me an amount and two email addresses where I need to mail the POP and request the account to be closed as well as a settlement letter to be emailed to me as proof the loan is now settled. Nothing has been done and customer service is useless! I refuse to pay another cent because I have settled this account.

Since then I have numerous times emailed and phoned to please close the account and email me a settlement letter. to Avail! Since Monday, 17 Jan 2022 every day I have received phone calls on the ""outstanding"" balance! Every time I had to explain the situation over again!",1
"African gave out my details and now I am jobless with nothing. That's customer info.

"My husband applied for a loan on the 11th of Jan he has been approved everything, got the message to say just a few more checks but still no money when you log in to app it says being reviewed. Also the debicheck has been created and accepted ao how come it takes 8 days and still no money and also no communication??
I mean seriously he phones everyday and just gets a it will be done by end of bussiness. Can someone please contact him urgently this is nonsese!people dont apply for loans just because.  Come on surely we applied cause we urgently need  it. 
Poor poor service !!!!",1
"The African Bank MyWorld account is being marketed as a zero/low fee account with good interest rates, but it is not true.  I have recently monitored my account and discovered that I am being charged for sms notifications when I have explicitly not selected this option when I opened the account.  In addition, they have also stopped giving me interest since Sept 2021 without any reason.

I logged a query with their customer service and they are unfortunately utterly useless.  They don't reply to emails and if you call them they basically log a ticket which automatically gets closed the next day.

Getting charged incorrect fees and not getting interest on positive balances is a serious issue, but the MyWorld support desk simply give a damn and have no interest in helping the customer.

I logged my query 2 weeks back and I was told today I must wait another 7 days for an answer, but they can't tell me how they will give me feedback.  I guess I must just hope and pray for someone to help???

I suggest their MyWorld division seek assistance and guidance from their Investment Division who have always given me stunning support, and they at least respond to emails.

I am at a point where I will be closing down the Myworld account as it has been falsely advertised and the service I have received is pathetic.",1
"Hi
I had a loan of which I settled last week on the 4th of January. I have been requesting for a paid up letter via email and calling African bank. I keep getting emails from African telling me that they will attend to me ,I even resorted to calling their customer services they just keep on sending me from pillar to post and promising me that they are emailing the paid up letter till this day.Im really not happy about this as I have already spent R180 worth of airtime trying to get help from their customer service.",1
So I got a loan of R48 000 and because of my financial strains i skipped few months without paying. Therefor after those months went to the bank made arrangements. They said fine i can pay R800 a month. Now it been 5 years and to my surprise i call want to check my balance they say it R177 000. How is that possible whilst i've been paying ok fine now i ask for a settlement amount they say its gona be R185000. What the hell. Isnt that it must go down when i settle or cut the interest.  Im so very disappointed in african bank its a scam u will never finish paying their loan. Its a death trap. I wish i can tell everyone never ever go to african bank its a real scam and robbing people.,1
"Hi,
I would like to please know how I can get a statement (proof of payment) for a SWIFT incoming deposit in my account?

"Took out a policy with them in 2021,where from the get go I told the consultant that my mom (who was going to be a beneficiary) is using a Lesotho passport,and I was assured that is not a problem,I went to the same branch in carletonville on Thursday to ask why I was not debitted on December n January and I'm told I need to find someone who uses an ID all of a sudden as my beneficiary (which I don't have), How many people have gone through the same just so they can eat our monies, applied for a refund and their service(head office) is just worse,5 days later NO FEEDBACK. 

I'd like to think y'all are bogus,people think twice before taking any policy with this company.",1
"And so it continues . . . Applied for an Credit Card offering by African Bank . .

"I received a credit card from African Bank. I only used the card for one day. The next day when I tried to use the card, it was blocked. When I called to find out the reasons, I was told it was due to FICA. Then the FICA issue was resolved. However my card is still not working. Terrible experience. I regret returning to African Bank as a client. Even the consultants that I called were not entirely helpful. I would not recommend African Bank to a a family member or friend. Thanks.

"Applied for a short term loan a week ago, was asked to submit documents yet everyday I'm asked to re-submit. When I call to ask if my documents have been received or not so I can make a decision whether its worth while to transact with African Bank. We apply for loans because we are in a time sensitive situation, what is the point of going through a lengthy application process when other institutes can do it faster. Can I receive a Yes or a No to my application so I can move forward",1
feedback on applications is never provided . the consultants provide false info and are very lazy to answer questions and give excuses when required to escalate matters to their team leaders.,1
Once more taking forever to assist and employees that make empty promises to assist or follow up and then never do,1
"So, I got a credit card from African Bank, never had a problem. debit my account every month on the 1st. Jan 2022 I have noted that African bank never debited my account. have been trying to get hold of them and sending many emails. to find out what is going on, African bank updated my credit profile for not making payment, this has affected my credit score and is not even my fault. I logged into my account and saw an arrears amount and paid it, African bank still did not update my credit profile with TransUnion. I am not sure why Africa bank charges me for service, seeing that I have to do the work for them. if Africa bank forgets to debit my account and has no respect to phone me. but easy this to list you for not paying. Do not go with the debit system, pay them directly, it seems thy debit order department is uneducated and untrained.",1
I have been trying to get my y-code. Called you guys from last week already and you keep on saying you are sending.how long does it take you guys to send a message with y code?your service is very poor.the only thing that makes your bank unique but you can't keep up with it.,1
"I am Lindiwe Nhlapho and have been a client of African bank. Today, i went to report a fruad i experienced on my world account where i tranfered to a scammer money. Upon realising this, i called the scammers bank (Tymebank) who immediately put a 24 hours block onto the account pending African bank's fraud department instructing Tymebank to block the account and investigate and hhopefully i can get my money back. I was assisted by Jabulile from African bank, however i was promised that a member of the fraud deprtment from African bank will call me. Its been over 5 hours and i am afraid that the scammer will withdraw my money before African bank can act. I have lost all hopes from my bank, they are unprofessional and don't care about clients. I am really desparate to get this money returned to me. Now any delays from my bank will lead to be losing my money that i need as a single mother in January of all months. I will report this matter with the bank's ambudsman as negligence and unfair and abuse of clients from African bank's side. I am feelign weak and useless as i wait for the call, and when i contacted the contact centre (african bank) i have been holding on the line for more that 30 minutes. Please help me, i am not ok.",1
"Hi I am very disappointed with your service this is the first time ever I have experience this type service. My application was completed the 6th January I then sent documents and ever since it's been in the review department but no one gets back to me.

"I needed a urgent loan with African Bank for medical reasons, I applied for this on the 4th of January, I have been calling 3-5 times a day trying to get an update, speaking to different people who tell me a different stories with each call, no one can give me an update, I have laid numerous complaints with promises of someone calling me back, and of course no one calls back.
I get given false information regarding this loan with every call I make.
This whole thing has cost me more money in airtime than anything else.
All I want is an answer
Yesterday I receive a sms : Your credit application is in progress and we are busy with income and expense review, Our offer to you will be ready soon.
When I called now I am told this is incorrect and that African Bank is still needing bank statements and pay slips, I have sent this numerous times. Does anyone actually know what they doing there???????????????????????????
8 days to review documents, only to be requested over and over again??????????????????????????????????
This is unacceptable!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Pathetic service!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!",1
I'm still waiting for then to send me my  mother's statement as she took a loan of r10.000 in 2012 and till today she's paying for it I I can't get the statement from 2012 online and I asked if they can email it to me still no one has responded,1
"For the 3rd time in 4 months I was offered a loan from african bank,I accepted the offer,sent thru the documents needs and all was well,the last two loans which was offered both expired cause african bank don't call and they don't communicate at all.i have to call every second day to ask about the loan, I need to hold for 15mins,then I'm told it's under review,why offer somebody something,when you know that they qualify and you just leave them hanging,yesterday the same thing happened,hopefully someone will call today.not even getting my hopes up.",1
"I have been banking with them since 2019, I loved the fact that I can withdraw money at any ATM for just R6/R7 at that time. I have asked them to switch off charged banking notifications of withdrawals, payments and purchases plenty of times, as I found it unnecessary for them to send me, for balance query I'd just have a look in my banking App. 

Their withdrawal fees increased to R9.50, whereas they gave me a fee charge book of R7.50. I noticed the fees on my statement and I looked on Business tech for updated banking fees which stated AB charged R8.50 from June 2021. 

I called them and they apologized for not informing me of the increased fees which I still find odd. All these years they were charging me incorrectly, even their website does not have updated fees sheet nor do their stuff know. I feel misled and my request of the R.40 notification fees has been charged even though I requested it turned off. 

I'm pretty sure all their other fees increased but I haven't noticed. 

I have complained with them, but no one has cared enough to switch off the notifications or tell me if they can't.",1
Am very very disappointed with how they respond to customers they say 48hrs that turn to be 7 days and they App online banking is not users friendly at all and when u call call center you get different answers all the time.,1
"Just like so many others who have logged complaints against this bank, I too have received the same terrible service, service which is sadly quite typical of South African businesses. In general the problem we have in South Africa is that nobody wants to actually do their job and yet everyone wants to get paid, get bonuses and increases etc.

Anyway, I digress. My complaint is basically the following: For weeks in December 2021 I was contacted almost daily by representatives of African Bank encouraging me to apply for a loan. On 30 December 2021 I finally gave in and applied as I figured I could use extra cash in the dreaded long January. I submitted my application online as well as all required documents. 

By 7 January 2022 I still had not heard anything from the Bank. I happened to be passing a branch and noticed that it was relatively empty, so I went in to enquire about my application.  The consultant could not assist as it was an online application,  thus he was not able to view anything in this application,  so he said. When I returned home, I phoned the help desk, another typical experience of South African poor service awaited. I held the line for an entire 25 minutes and 33 seconds before someone finally answered. Yes, I timed it.

The consultant on the phone gave me the samevresponse that I see many others on this platform have received,  "" Oh I will escalate your query to management and they will contact you within 24 hrs. Well, that was 3 days ago. To date I have still heard nothing from the bank. It is now 10 January 2022, remember I initially applied on 30 December 2021. 
In this time I have read so many negative comments about this Bank concerning the typical terrible service one receives by most businesses in South Africa in general,  that I have actually decided that I no longer want their loan. In fact it has taken so long,  that I no longer need it. In any event I rather not deal with a business that provides such terrible customer service. I would therefore strongly advise any other potential clients who value good old fashioned good service the way I do, to simply steer clear of this very typically run South African business.  Yes, I know I keep making reference to South African businesses and their poor service in general.  But that is just sadly a reality of this country the terrible service filters right down from government and has become very common place amongst many a business.  The very few places that still uphold good old fashioned quality customer service in SA are few and far between,  but those must be commended. 
In summary,  African Bank has provided such slow and pathetic service that I would rather not deal with them ever again.

Thanks",1
"I deposited a lump sum in my African Bank Tax free saving account on the 05 Jan 2022. Until today the lump sum is not reflecting in my account. I visited the branch and also called the savings and investment department, the consultants  cannot tell me where my money is. Can African Bank give me my money back instead of sending me from pillar to post with no answers. Your customer service is the worst I have experienced, I regret trusting you as a financial service provider. It has been unpleasant doing business with you AFRICAN BANK!!!!!",1

"Empty Promises and then threatening messages
End December 2021 you promised that the Insurance for unemployment will be sorted out within a week, after me begging you since JULY 2021 and then eventually reporting you on this platform.

Please refund me the complete amount I have paid for this insurance that is worth nothing and I will repay my loan with it",1
"I have been having a problem with the Credit card since I took it I have reported this issue a several times on the Call center and at the Florida branch, but still no solution for my issue, I have used the credit card when I have money and the transaction declined and I was charged a declined fee when I was swiping the card, the strange thing is that I was able to transfer money from the same credit card on the same day to my savings account, the transaction did not decline, dates 12/12/2021 and 05/01/2022

In October I purchased electricity for R100, and I did not receive the voucher for electricity and when I check on the statement it was saying the transaction failed, but the amount was deducted, I am still waiting for the refund,

Can you please assist with this issues that I am having",1

On 30th December 2021 I phoned head office African bank asking to update my new banking details and request to change mandates in order for me to authorise new debicheck from my Nedbank Cheque Account but they failed to do so. My credit card and loans are due now because I can't pay them even if I check my African bank app still showing my previous account. I tried calling many times for your assistance and I only receive sms stating D/O has been updated.I am not happy with thier service. The next thing I will be placed as a bad debtor for not being consistent.,1
"I am sad that I have to go to these lengths because I honestly thought your company holds to their promises. I have gone this route because I am beyond frustrated being shoved from pillar to post. My conversation with African Bank Fb messenger consultant will illustrate my issue here. 

""African Bank, I am really not happy with your turn around time. You advertise credit cards 'with instant access'. I've submitted all my documents to you, certified documents, you approve and send me my policy documents and 2 days later still no sms to say my card has been activated. I've called your call center, first time I waited from 15h40 until 16h30 for someone to take my call and I eventually gave up. This morning someone spoke to me and said they would escalate to their team leader but the honest truth of the matter is that whatever checks that needed to be done could've been done on Friday. Lackluster and empty promises. I'm really not impressed with the empty promises and there is never any feedback given.""

African bank: Hi Jamie-Lee We're here for you, even during lockdown. We’re dedicated to helping you ASAP. Hi Jamie-Lee, applications normally take around 1-2 working days (This excludes weekends and public holidays) to be processed, once all the correct documents have been submitted for assessment. You can keep track of the status of your application by using our App, or by calling **********. ^Thandz.

""I have submitted all the correct documents already, as stated in my first message to you. Banking statements and payslips for 3 months, showing my date of employment. Friday was day 2, so you guys are behind. Please have this sorted by Monday, I am honestly losing my patience.""

Get this sorted African Bank and redeem yourselves. Good grief. My documents were submitted on the 5th of January. No excuse for this delay.",1

"This morning I went into African Bank’s website with the hope of opening a MyWorld account. When registering to create an online profile a notification returned to indicate that I already have an account with African Bank which I never have. 

I called the call center and was transferred on to a sales person despite indicating my concerns that this is fraud related. The sales person, Snethemba, acted as though she was placing me on hold to find and provide a number for the fraud department only to return me back to the menu. I phone two more times only to be informed by the last sales person that she did not know the fraud department number which I find shocking.

This is very poor service and I am utterly disgusted by the disregard shown about a matter as serious as fraud!!",1

"My african bank pin blocked i called and i spoke to Mamphoto who asked security questions about my acc which she claims the systems find those answers incorrectly and i asked her.. How is that possible because those are my detail, id, address, cell number beneficiary.. Their system is ridiculous.. They just want people to go to the branch for such a small thing.. Imagine using transport fare for something that can be rectified over the phone or even online.. AFRICAN BANK yol need to fix your system.. I cant be going to the branck for pin blocked while other Apps one is able to reset on line.. You so inconsiderate, unprofessional and unhelpful ur App is pathetic. I asked to speak to the supervisor /Team leader. Mamphotho Said they in the meeting. (as always) they never availble when they needed to intevene or assist clients, this call was made around 10 am today.. Now its 3pm all day they in meeting.. Yol dont appreciate your clients only when you calking us to tale loans, funeral covers and your service you know who we are.. A mere block pin is it that hard to assist.. And also your app is nonsense cos it blocks our pin even if u put correct details.even a friend of mine few months bad went to The Branch and they assisted even wrote on the msall paper of all the login details, but soon as we get home an enter your stupid app gives us an error.

"I was indebted to African Bank. An agreement was made that if I settle the debt by 31 December 2021, then I will receive a 30% discount on the debt. They sent me settlement letters stating  the amount that needed to be paid and the due date.

I paid the total of the debt on the said date,as per the letter from African Bank.
When I asked for a statement too see that I now owe nothing, it was still showing that I owed money.

When I contacted them it was said that because the money only reflected in their account 3 days later, it still showed that I owed the balance of the debt.

As far as I am concerned my debt is paid up to date as I paid the total as stipulated by African Bank on the debt mentioned by them. They should have looked on my profile to see if there was any arrangement made before allocating the money to my debt and then they would have seeing the letter on my profile.

Obviously the correct procedure was not followed by them. I even sent the proof of payment which shows the date the payment was made, and they still got it wrong.

Will take it further if I have to.",1

My other half purchased a puppy through a company called Billy French Bulldogs, she had to pay courier costs to a company called We Move Pets who has a account with African Bank. and EFT was done via ABSA of the amount of R9650. This was a scam which we reported to SAPS (Case number CS54/11/2021) and ABSA (Case number  ASZA**********70). Absa has advised that no funds could be retrieved any money back and African Bank refused to help. I think this absolutely disgraceful service that African Bank allows scammers to open bank accounts (Which this person obviously used a fake ID and personal details). So this tells me that either you do not care about people's hard earned money being stolen from them or African Bank consultants are working with these scammers as African Bank refused to assist with returning these funds.

"Dear African,

This is my 3rd letter to you.
Two weeks ago I requested a settlement letter.  After receiving it I attempted to make a payment but it couldn't be verified by the bank.  I was told to transfer the money to African Bank Credit Card - which didn't work but eventually I managed to get through the call centre and I was told to either pay via online or use African Bank Loans.
First I did the online version cause I though it would be efficient - but I had to split the amount into 2.  Nothing happened. After 2 day I call in and was told that option doesn't work. So I transfered the full amount via FNB. As luck would have it the money I had transfered via online gets deducted. When I call in I got so many versions of why and what and when.
All I want is the account to be closed and the R15 916.34 refunded.  I don't care about all these other charges.  I want my money back especially because the agent lied and said no deduction will take place.
But prior to do that I had paid R",1

I feel like this is unfair especially considering the fact that they have my payment history and can see that i have tried my best to pay, it feels like they just want to choke me to death, its not nice owing a personal loan for this long.

"Hi,

I have contacted an agent at SARS who told me that no application has been made by African Bank to add the SARS tax payment accounts to African Bank's list of beneficiaries.

I have been querying this problem with African Bank since September 2020 after being unable to pay my taxes online through my MyWorld account in August that year.
The bank told me that they would escalate the issue, but the only feedback I get is that it is a long process to add these accounts.

This is quite an inconvenience, since I have to find someone else to pay my taxes through their ABSA or FNB account who does have the facility.
I cannot open a mainstream banking account purely for the purposes of paying my provisional taxes every 6 months as I find this ridiculous.

It seems then that according to SARS on their system no attempt or application has been made by the bank to sort out this issue.

I REQUEST THAT SOMETHING URGENTLY PLEASE BE DONE ABOUT THIS PROBLEM, SINCE I SURELY CANNOT BE THE ONLY ONE WITH AN AFRICAN BANK SAVINGS ACCOUNT THAT PAYS TAXES?!",1

"I took a credit card in July from African Bank the amount in the card was R87 000,00 and i used about R 53 000,00. A few weeks passed then i realized that somthing was wrong with my acc, i went to the branch to get it checked out only to find out that there was a huge amount of money that was taken out while as i didn't use my card since there was looting . The teller told me that my card was hacked somehow and it was being used in Johannesburg, she forwarded my case to the forensic team they said it was being investigated , Mr Jabulani Kabini was the one investigating my case and he sent me an email on the 7th of September informing me that it would only take a month after that i didn't hear from him or the branch . Every Friday i would visit the branch to get updates but nothing , they would email him but still nothing . In October they started deducting money from my acc which was R 4 091,00 , in November the deducted R 3 900.00 and they have already sent me a message that they will deduct R 3 800.00 and mind you the card is blocked because of the investigation but they still deducting money .
I need help ASAP ...",1
"I cannot transfer money using my banking app or using internet banking, an error message keeps appearing when I try to send money",1
My loan application was submitted on 6 December with relevant documentation. The next day I received an SMS that they require my latest payslip (Already uploaded). So I go in and upload it again. Same story the next day. We are now on day 4 and still nothing has been done. This after I've now uploaded and emailed all my documentation. Phoning the call center is absolutely no help either. It seems everyone works with a sheet in front of them with generic responses. No one can help me complete the application. Horrible experience with African Bank!,1
"Its been 2 days since I applied for credit card and since then I have been recieving SMS's requesting documents which I have been sending from the time I started my online application. Is it people or robots who reviews our applications? Because honestly I am sick and tired of this process inefficiencies.

Your service really sucks. To think that I was planning to move from FNB private wealth portfolio to African bank, clearly that wouldn't be a great idea. You are still not technologically advanced.",1
"African Bank has to be by far the most unprofessional bank in this continent! Our country and people do not need a bank like this.  I got an SMS from African Bank saying I qualify for a payment break but when I log in to apply the break, it said there was no break. After being on hold for over 30 minutes, the consultant advised that they made a mistake 5 days ago and sent out the communication. 

Never did these people consider sending up a follow up sms advising that this communication was in error because that's how little they think of their customers. I am so shocked.",1
"I've been trying to get hold of African bank on the phone and i even went to the bank and they told me they cant assist me, so i received an SMS to say my debit order will be processed on the 15th and i am only getting paid on the 20th, please can you urgently call me back??????????????????????",1
"Deposited funds 29 November till today 10th December still no straight answer, account is on hold, all requested documents I have sent but no one seems to know what the issue is, have been told 72 hours and 24 hours and issue was resolved but still I can't withdraw or transfer my money, I don't recommend this bank to anyone at all, am beyond frustrated and all I want is my money back and move to another bank coz the service is just horrendous, head office never picks up and when they do call back they drop the call as if they can't hear you, social media guy was helpful but still issue not resolved, if I knew I would have never deposited my savings at all.",1
"I have never recieved such bad service I applied for a loan and was approved on the 1st of December 2021 I uploaded all my docs and was informed that all my documents was correct and that my loan will be finalized like in yesterday already afterbi called this morning I was informed that the contract would be done as there is an error on the system and now I have received a SMS again for a bank statement. 

I am unhappy and wish to report this to the NCR as this is not treating your client fairly. A whole week it takes",1
"I was a client of African Bank and paid my account monthly, but had to go on Debt Review. I paid the repayment plan over monthly for 6 years only to find that the Debt Review Company was a fly by night. I paid R7000 per month for over 6 years to clear my debt. 

I am finally off Debt review and when I called African Bank to enquire on an account, I was notified that payments were not made over. How was I then taken off debt review. Now I am yet again needing to pay. no solutions were given by African Bank, just rude service. 

This is such an injustice system. You pay 6 years EVERY month to clear your name. I am not sure if my payments were unallocated but the service received was shocking, making me feel like a criminal. I went on debt review and granted from 2011. I paid monthly as I wanted to honor the accounts.",1
"I have credit card with African bank someone within  change my  details and withdrew money,my account is blocked and I'm paying interest for the money I didn't use, it's now 4th month following up no resolution, since your unable to resolve this issue may kindly request CEO contact details, please note that if this is not resolved tomorrow I be cantacting all Radio stations so that we can communicate with the executives, it's very clear that African is a scam and very Incompetent.",1
"On Wednesday the 8th of December I was surprised to wake up to find that my account has been ""placed on hold"" as I learned yesterday. this was done without prior notification of any kinda, not by phone call or email with either one being options to reach me considering the bank has such details. And after 2 conscutive days of trying to reach out to African Bank,I recieved two virtually non-chalant responsese, and as of right now this very moment at 14:28 i have been waiting for a response to a slew ofemails I have sent to the customer care mail and waited on hold for a ssistance for long periods of time and I stilll cannot access my account. I can recieve or use any of the money in my account, my lights have been switched off where I live because I am unable to recieve money into my account meant to be paid into my rent. Yes I am foreign nation but that does not give you the right to threat me like this. How exactly am I meant to do anything with a frozen account and subpar service.",1
"Am still waiting on resolution,  I wascrectreched avatar ago,sent documentation for my retrechment and to date I still pay for the account even after I submitted for credit life,I logged a complaint and I received an SMS stating that the complaint was closed as they did not receive the documents, perhaps send me the address then I can hand deliver them,African bank will never change for anything better,interest rates are ridiculous, customer service is poor and nothing to he right,this bank is a scam i tell you.",1
"I took a loan with African Bank, have been paying until i got retrenched at work in Jan 2020. I submitted all required documents to their insurance, after that i got calls from different agencies asking for the same document or forcing me to pay the debt.

Till today i have not heard from the insurance, however, they kept on tracing my account and taking what ever is there.  I called African Bank several times to ask why are they deducting my account, then i get told the matter will be escalated but the same thing will happen month on month.

Even yesterday i got a call from their agency asking can they reduce my instalment - really???  Why is the insurance not covering the debt as promised!!",1
"I have a loan with African Bank, in October I requested to settle the loan for a period of 12 months of which initially it was supposed to be 30 months, the person who assisted me did as I requested end of October the amount agreed upon was debited from my account initially it was R775.61, the upon agreement of settlement it was R1002.94, in October a statement came which was having wrong information because the amount of money now being debited has changed I tried to communicate with them they sent the correct statement

End of November they debited R775.61 of which I requested to be changed

I don't know what to do now because seemingly they don't want me to settle the amount

Can I please get legal assistance",1
"I have a 90 day savings account with African Bank. I placed notice on it in September. I called along the way to confirm that my withdrawal is being processed, which they confirmed it is. I got a letter from them confirming so and that my funds will be paid to me by the 8th (which is today). I call today to confirm all is on track and I get told that it will be paid out on the 9th. 

It may be one day difference but why are they not communicating with me about the change? 

The last thing I want to hear is that the date gets pushed back without notice again.

I'd be grateful if someone from African Bank gets in contact with me on this.",1
I did an application on 29 November 2021 and after nearly 50 phones calls I was appalled that an offer made to me by them was declined.... How stupid is that?? Not to mention when enquires where made i received the same answer daily.  Now today 10 days later im told my application was declined.  They're a total waste of time and money,1
"I applied online for a credit card limit increase and the application was in progress when I missed the final steps. The application has requested me to contact the call centre its outstanding information but the call centre sales agent wants to start the application from scratch.
The application has already given me an offer amount that I have already confirmed but the sales agent is insisting to start over with the application.
The Sales agent is rude and as well does not listen to the information but insists on starting over with the application.
The Login details as well to reset have been giving me a problem since August and I am having problems logging in with the username and it keeps insisting on a password I no longer remember.
This has taken 8 hours of my day today, holding and being transferred only for the agent to be of no help.
I definitely wasted a day, being someone who is bringing business to you.
The online application and Resetting of passwords, together with your OTP PINneeds to be looked into.",1

I have been trying to get hold of customer service for a week.  Can someone assist.,2
"I received an SMS from them advising that I qualify for a break,  When I went online to activate it there was nothing.  I then called them only to be told that its an error from their side and they would correct it and come back to me,  When I heard nothing I called and spoke to Bonolo that there is nothing anyone can do not even the CEO.  it was a mistake. I spoke to the team leader Pyarbya wo said the same thing.  I WANT MY PAYMENT BREAK..  I didnt ask you to send me the SMS.  Which means you send communication to your customers that you cant stand by.",1
"They give a reward when you swipe your bank card ten times a month.
EVERY MONTH I don't get my reward, and after endless phone calls and sometimes ten days later I finally receive my reward. Some months I spend more money on phone calls to get the reward, than what the reward is worth.",1

"06 December 2021

SMS received ""Need a BREAK? Why not take an African Bank 1 month payment break on your loan 65***2007. Activate your break by **********0 on our App or register at www.africanbank.co.za ....""

After driving 9.1 Kms to Tyger Valley Centre who is unable to get my app working on iOS or Android OS, best advice try at home as the reception is bad in the centre. While driving 12:33 SMS received ""Hello, you have blocked your African Bank profile...""

Again in the car this time 20.6Kms off to John Montague Centre, Montague Gardens who finally figured my bluetooth and wifi must be off and app needs to run over cellular data.

I have now logged into the App and Website and ZERO payment break available!!!!
Website ""There are currently no available breaks.""
App ""Warning There are no eligible account"" with only Home or Retry which both presents ZERO option to activate!!!
All this after paying on time without a single payment missed since our 1st agreement in 2007!!!!

While we at it, Who said African Bank can debit before the 25th of each month??
25 - 27 Aug were all normal working days, yet African Bank was GREEDY on 23 Aug to debit before the time and I paid R90 Honouring Fee!!!

I want my payment break activated and my Honouring Fee reimbursed!!!!!!!",1
"I received the worst experience ever. My husband went for a loan at African Bank
 The lady Sharlin Lawrence at airport mall branch had the most unfriendly personality. 

We were informed the money will be in our account yesterday Monday 6 December 21. Only to be told when we got to the bank at 3 pm that another payslip is needed.

I then peovided it immediately. Sharlin said it will be in our account before closing time.

This morning i messaged again at 9 am i was told by here application is almost complete. It is now 12pm and im still waiting on the money to be paid into the account. 

The customer service sucks im in customer service myself and would never be so unprofessional.

I also would never recommend anyone to your bank.

Regards
Mrs M Thompson",1
African bank is incompetent when it comes to resolving complaints. No one wants to take responsibility . And their IT department is the worst. No matter what you do your complaint  will not be taken seriously and will remain unresolved.,1

I applied for a a loan on the 1st I'm still waiting, have to call with my airtime only to send from pillar to post, you can just imagine how frastrating it is 4 days and counting.

I can confirm that African Bank does not worry about their clients.

I was there to dispute the debit orders and I was told that they couldn't do that. I was on call for an hour and my dispute was not resolved. The money was taken from Capitec account and it is from the social grant. Now I don't have money for food for my kids. I'm no longer working,1
"Guys how do I actually take a complaint higer in regards to African Bank?

So previously money was taken out of my account from an online shop. I went to African bank and they couldn't resolve this matter. I completely understood cause they said it's something I opt-in.

They said they will block my world account and give me a new card right. This was such a mission that the consultant advised me to use one of my pocket account.
Left there.

On the 29th I deposited money into one of my pocket accounts. When the money never reflected I went to the brach,  checked on my Bank statements money didn't even reflect and this money was deposited by cash.The consultant logged in incident of a lost money case, told me it would take 48hrs to be resolved.

48hrs is long passed, nobody communicates regarding your lost money, I've sent 2 emails already nobody responded.

Why must I run up and down to the branch when the error is not on my side??

Still today it's almost going for 72hrs, no response!
This is pathetic so I'd like to take this further.

So glad their not my only Bank.
Still I want my money!",1
"Hi aafrican bank. If you guys are tired of customer service and customer delivery just so so. This thing of you claiming you are the best while one has to call you everymoth and wait hours just to tell you we can't get what you promised and your customer service people not knowing anything. It was you who said you giving rewards for swiping 10 times and more, we never bagged you to. You guys are failing in that department. The only thing making you different from other banks, cos ur customer is is very poor and they lack information.",1
"This is my third rating of African Bank. They are still phoning me to make arrangements on an account of which i have R11k available (According to their own statement) . But still they keep phoning me for arrangements, although they have a debit order?? I am beyond frustrated. This rating will help nothing, they will open a complaint like last time and then send me a sms to say it has been resolved. ANYONE THAT READS THIS, STAY CLEAR OF THIS BANK, THEY ARE THE WORST !!!!",1
"Okay, I am beyond ****ed off.

I attempted to buy electricity on the app but received an error stating that the transaction could not be completed try again later. I attempted again and the transaction was successful.

I received the one sms with the token and the other didn't come through. I then checked my account balance and noticed that the balance was R250.00 less. 

I would like a refund on R250.00 as the first transaction was unsuccessful and the funds were not deducted from my balance as i still had the same amount of funds available when i made the second purchase for electricity.

So i would like a refund of R250.00. I am aware that electricity is sold through a third party however as a Bank exception can be made where they are wrong. Request the ITA logs for the app if you have to. 

I would also like to claim compensation for the past two weeks of non stop issues. Complaints, after complaints.... I opened this account with you on the 19/11/2021 and have had endless issues with African Bank.

Please escalate this to your CEO complaints. If i do not get a refund for the token purchased and compensation for the horrible service (Yes, from the day i collected my card i had issues) I will be logging matters to the ombudsman should this not be taken seriously.",1
"Reap offs... They promise payment breaks and that affects itc as non payment and they don't tell you that. All they can say is sorry. Receive sms's saying I haven't paid my account meanwhile they are the 1st people to debit my account... You pay their loan till you are blue on the face, balance doesn't go down. Pathetic service.... I regret the day I took out a loan with these sharks.",1
"What a useless bank and service
1 week with them 3 times drove 30km  to a nearesy branch while trying to do some things at the bank the lady decided to chat on whatsapp and calling her ""liefie"" while a client is in front waitng to be asisted.the suddenly my bank is frozen card has been stoped.7emails further post on fb still no feedback why it has been blocked",1
They keep on debiting my account despite the Debt Review people making an arrangement with them. We sent them all the documents and they still would debit my account. I lost a lot of money in bank charges. The Walk in centre and call center are useless. They take almost a month to return the money.,1
I paid off their 2 loans in 2019. Till today I am still owing them. I even referenced the matter to the credit ombudsman.  This equally failed to assist.  What a stupid idea of having a business with this African Bank.,1
"In the past 2 days they have blocked my account 4 times. These damn idiots who block the account don't e en follow up after doing so it's me who calls a 100 times to sort the issue. All they know is we will escalate the issue. And Nutting gets done. If they do not know what to do they should say so and I can move my funds to tyke bank as I have just activated my card.
These ppl at the call center are a bunch of useless picks who can't even assist.
Please sort the issue and ask them to wake up.

Cannot wait to be finished with this bank. Bunch of crooks! I have a 11k available which i cannot access cause i fell behind during covid. IVE PAID MORE THAN WHAT I WAS BEHIND WITH< AND ALL THE INTEREST! If you ever have a feeling of becoming an African Bank client, please sit down till the feeling passes.
THE WORST BANK  OUT THERE!",1
"i applied for a loan 10th November, i have been in to 3 different branches, called the call center a million times, no one can help me and no one has answers for me expect that it is being reviewed, from the 10th Nov? really? today is the 23rd of November how long does it take? and there is no customer service on either side, the staff at westagate look at you like you have a disease, the staff at southgate put you through to the call center and you do everything and the staff at florida goldman just tell you its being reviewed, if i wanted that answer, i could of checked the online system myself",1

Good day.  I have an existing arrangement with African Bank on all 3 of my loan accounts and the payment went off via debit order.  I am receiving emails and calls from a company called Concept Recoveries for payment arrangement.  Why am i getting emails and calls fro arrangment when an arrangment is already in place with African Bank.,2
"Great service from everyone that has been involved in my queries or assisting me at the branch & call center level BUT i have been trying to get a loan with this bank the entire month, with no question that i do qualify but athe actual process is so annoying. I applied initially for a loan on the first week of November, uploaded and emailed ALL documents needed... kept getting the same response, that my bank statements weren't clear. called the call center and a lovely lady assisted saying the August bank statement was not attached, stayed with her on the line and emailed the documents AGAIN... she then said she escalated the matter and I would be contacted. Days later, still get the same feedback... i have sent the documents to 123@africanbank & ABdocs AND uploaded under my profile, used the APP and even sent them 3 times via whatsapp!!! this is ridiculous. I am so defeated at this stage and i need to sort out my school registrations",2
"I have had an appalling service from African bank. I called in requesting for a settlement discount on two account that I have had with them for some years. The discount they offered me was too low and I asked them if they could reconsider. I was told to send an email to *********** and the turn around time for the response would be up to 72 hours. This was on the 11th November and I have the mails to prove this. The 72 hours passed and no one had made contact with me, I called again and explained this situation, spoke to  Margaret who put me on hold for 25 minutes until the call cut. I called right back and the consultant I spoke to said she escalated the matter and a supervisor would call me and no one has made contact with me since. How do I settle these accounts if none of them call me back, they want me to continue paying this account in small installments. The only time they will contact you is if you miss an installment. I have paid these accounts over a couple of years already and I know that they do give bigger settlement discounts. I want to clear my credit profile and they are standing in my way of doing so, all they want is to keep taking my money and the debt is standing at one place, it has been years. Every time I call I need to tell the store to a new consultant each time and I am kept on hold until the call cuts, then I have to call back and start the story from the beginning. They are the worst credit bank out there, STAY AWAY from them, they do not care about customers. They just want your money. The only way they will contact me is if I return my debit order, then they will call me non stop.",1

I went to African bank on the 15November 2021 to request for loan apparently they consolidated all my loans x 3 at African Bank and x 3 at Old Mutual then they gave me change. I received the money on 16November 2021. When I go to Old Mutual requesting for paid up letter they claim if loans still active and they requested me to bring the proof of payment. I went to African Bank to request for proof of payment on the 17November 2021 they promise to email it after 24hours but till today they have not furnish me with proof of payment please assist me because according to signed contract they stated that they have settled Old Mutual and the Officers which I was referred to Customer Care they claim if settled but they do not issue me the proof of payment. My worry is that on December 2021 the 15th they will debit the instalment for the debt which am not sure they settled because they not issuing me the proof of payment.,1
"Always have a bad service with their consultants at Westgate Mall branch. The lady who was helping me on Wednesday 17/11/2021, looks so bored the moment I walked in the door.
It was like I'm disturbing her moment of sitting around doing nothing.
I had a problem and still have it now because the matter has not been resolved. My voucher number is not working and since I got it 3 weeks back. Everytime I go purchase with it its declining, I went to the branch to ask for help but I walked away not being helped",2
"I had a credit card with African Bank and after I was behind with my payments the account was handed over to Concept Discoveries. After some payments, I was told that I qualify for a discount if I settled the amount required. I was forwarded the letter confirming that the account closure request was sent.. When I checked my credit report the account was still existing and I called Concept Discoveries and they said that it will be updated on the next report. I didn't hear anything from the company or african bank until this week. I received a message that I still have an outstanding amount of work. I requested a call back and after waiting on the line for more than 15 minutes, an agent named Collette Mtshweni came on the line to assist. I told her what had happened and she said to me that she was going to log a call to request an account closure. I said am not paying the account though , asking a question and she said with an attitude ""I said hold on the line because I need to log a call.""  when she came back on the line I asked again if I have to pay the amount and she ""that's why I was logging a call and you will get feedback if need to pay or not""  I then said to her you are not giving me a yes on no answer or explaining to me that the feedback will give me an accurate answer. She said to me"" I told you that I need to log a call ,  so what didn't you understand "". .she said to me what else do you need assistance with obviously disregarding and disrespecting me. This girl was not professional and has an disgusting attitude. She clearly doesn't know what customer care is, I don't wish for anyone to deal with her disrespect and arrogance. So annoyed..",1

"Been waiting since Nov 2 for a letter from African bank stating that they can't return funds to me that I paid into a fraudulant account in October so that I can claim those funds from my insurer. I've sent them numerous emails to them and their fraud department, of which all emails seem to have just been deleted and ignored! I tried calling the fraud department only to be told that they don't take calls and everytime I call African bank, they have no records of any of my previous phone calls or emails with regards to this letter. They are delaying my claim for almost a month now and I'm super ****ed!! The most useless service and people working there!!! My email to the fraud department was sent to a Hendrik Sanders who also just ignores his emails and never comes back to me - its like he doesn't even exist!!! Have officially reported them to the ombudsman for banking services as well.",1

Pathetic",1
"Still nothing. As it is International Fraud Awareness week I have reported the matter. Quick recap. Lots of “pre-approved” offers from AB. Applied was declined because apparently we owe money. I formally objected. My husband then got a call claiming that the WhatsApp messages are a scam being perpetuated by a mysterious third force. AB are aware of the scam and are investigating. Also we don’t owe them money as the account has prescribed and been written off. Naturally no mention of the credit guarantee policy kicking in because of the retrenchment. To summarise, we don’t owe them anything, our information was hacked and used to send false offers. The loan was declined because the account prescribed and was written off. According to the NCA this cannot be used against you. I don’t know which is worse. Knowing that thousands of people are being scammed or breaking the law. I have brought this to the attention of every board member as well as the CEO. The silence is deafening",1
"I have a loan account with this bank and they take the debit order when ever they feel like it!  I have been to the bank and they tell me to contact the call center which rings forever and a day!

Nadette responded with one line letter and say the case is pending, Its being 3 months waiting for a feedback from forensic with regard to the outcome of the investigation.

"Be aware that the interest of the 60 months fixed deposit with payment of interest after maturity is taxed every year - and NOT AFTER EXPIRY as the staff on ground is trained to let you know. This means you have to pay tax on interest that you cannot access. In larger investments, this can become a real cash flow problem. For the bank to not inform the client accordingly upon signing is problematic, incorrect - and unethical. We learned about it through experience - and the staff on ground confirmed that this is what they are supposed to say. The management has not called back yet - despite promise. Who is surprised.",1
"I had loan  2 accounts with African Bank one of which I have paid up 5 or 6 months ago and yet was still being  debited for both accounts on a monthly base I had to reverse the debit order because I had an arrangement with African Bank but they were not debiting the amount that was agreed on  my debit orders bounced monthly and I was charged for it until  I went into one of the branches to enquire I was advised that my account is paid up and I will receive a paid up letter within 14 days and they will reverse the funds into my account ,it took a  week for the funds to be credited back but and all the charges were not paid.",1
"WOW! 
I actually have no words to express how absolutely blown away I have been with my experience with African Bank! 
Their business model and technology that backs that up are INCREDIBLE! 
It has taken only 2 days for me to get to the point in a credit card application where I am just waiting for final review/risk assessment to activate my credit card/funds. At every single step of the way their response and communication was almost instant, either an sms, email or phone call from an actual human being offering assistance with the process!  I literally hit the submit button, at two different points in the process, via their online application and received a phone call IMMEDIATELY. WOW.  
As a Lead Business Analyst with 8 years experience in a software dev company doing BA, Product Ownership and UI/UX design amongst other things - I am SERIOUSLY IMPRESSED!  I had to go into my nearest branch to sort out a minor technical error, and again the service is incredible, a consistent experience throughout!
Amazing customer service, sleek application process, web design etc. - your tech team are doing it right!",5

"In April of 2020 when my salary was reduced due to Covid I was approved for my credit insurance to cover 3 months instalments. Fast forward to June 2021, consultants starting calling me to make arrangements for the arrears on my account. Impossible as my debit order has been going off every month. Turns out the June 2020 instalment was never paid by African Bank as they required my June 2020 bank statement, which nobody informed me about. After countless phone calls the June 2020 instalment has now been paid in October 2021 but the arrears is still sitting on my account, tarnishing my credit record! As a result of the arrears my credit card has been blocked! I have been advised by a consultant to email Carol Hlalele and Lanie Van Staden which I did 13 days ago and following up in between. 13 Days and nobody has come back to me with even just a 'I will get back to you'. Terribly disappointed in the lack of service as I am a loyal customer for many years. Stay as far away from this bank as possible!",1

"We keep getting mails from African Bank offering us “pre-approved” loans.

When African Bank say “pre-approved” what exactly does it mean? Nobody seems to be able to give me a coherent answer.

Then I would like to address the moral issue of the situation. I think that it is potentially very hazardous to make advances to people who may be desperate and then to shut them down. What are you going to do if some poor sod jumps off a building with one of your pre-approved promises in his hand and a note that reads something along the lines that he thought he had found a solution only to discover that it wasn’t what it said?

And lastly you obviously got leads off some data purchased somewhere. Where does that leave you in terms of Poppi and the NCR?

My husband did have a loan from African Bank and as per Standard Banking Practise he had credit guarantee insurance. When he lost his job that should have covered the loan. What happened to that money?

I look forward to your response",1

I have been in the branch for than 5 times and have been in communication with your customer service team over the phone.

Today after about 10 credit checks on my credit bureau we did the application again.

Last week I wrote up on Hello Peter, I get a call from a gentleman who basically told me that he will ensure that my private information is removed from the sales department so that African Bank does not contact me to offer me anything again.",1

"A deposit was made into my bank account on 28/10 today is the 5th of November and my funds have not reflected in my bank account. I have contacted customer services several times this week and sent through payment confirmation, but this has still not been resolved. I have never worked with a bank that is so backward, how does money just disappear in a bank when you have an account number?  I cannot wait to terminate this bank account!!!  It's shocking that I have to call a bank to allocate my payment, when that should be the point of banking!

Yesterday a consultant confirmed my payment confirmation was received and she has sent it to the payments department, today I called in and it was escalated to a team leader to call me, nobody contacted me.. I called back and it was escalated to the payments department, still checked my bank app and the funds have not reflected. The funny thing is a payment was made to my capitec ban account as well and this reflected in. Y account the very next day, but African Bank is just a mystery right now",1

I received an automated phone call stating i must send through the correct documents.  I spoke to somebody via your FB inbox system, with no luck.  I tried phoning but no answer. I submitted a request on your webpage for anybody to phone me back. I am still waiting.  I applied for a loan through African bank for the good service.  At this moment the service is a disaster.  I cant wait 48 hours.  This is what is happening now.  I am really unhappy about the service that is provided.",1

"Good day, I had a loan with African bank back in 2012 which I failed to pay back because of retrenchment. I submitted all the retrenchment letter that we required African bank required from me. But up to so far I am still having a flag on their records even though I was told that in case of retrenchment the loan will be cancelled.

Now I even took a stand to switch my salary to African bank because I really wanted be work and sort out the matter with them

I really don't mind paying them back now because I am working and financially stable.

All I am asking them is to pay whatever amount that I am owing or the FLAG be removed.

"hi, I opened an account online then visited their branch in Maponya mall to fetch my card. The first thing I didn't like was the fact that the consultant told me that their system is slow but he was busy on his phone, to be honest I doubt that the system was slow. he told me to put my thumb on the biometrics system and a minute later started asking me questions about when was my Markhams account opened and how much was my loan at Absa. I got irritated and I told him that I'm not applying for a loan and I will not answer such questions for picking a card. Then he told me that I have failed the biometric test that's why he was asking me the questions and he can not proceed. I needed the card since I had already transfered money into the account, so answered his questions then he told me that I did not accept terms and conditions when I opened the account online, so he will escalate my query and someone will call me then I will return to the branch to pick up the card after getting the call. Why so many hurdles just to pick up a card for an account that is already opened and I was able to transact on it. I don't know if there's a branch manager at African Bank Maponya mall branch because i asked these questions and everyone inside the branch was listening to me and the consultant but a branch manager never showed up to assist me or the consultant because he could not answer me. on the same day I opened an account with Tyme bank, went to Pick n pay and a tyme bank consultant at the store helped me with printing the card. this took less than 30 minutes and I was never asked about my loan with Absa and Markhams account. Your branch is hostile. You have no one to assist you before you see the consultants.",1
I am very dissappointed in the service I have gotten from African Bank the past two months! Due to African Bank not being able to sort out their mistakes on my Credit Card my credit scire has now dropped with 42 points and they listed me as being in arrears which I am not as I havent skipped one payment and I actually have a credit available. I have also been struggling to get my credit card active with them for the past two months due to their own errors.,1
I have an African Bank personal loan and a credit card which was opened more than 10 years ago firstly I have tried on multiple occasions to get hold of African Bank but when I call the agents tell me verification has been failed and they can't help me the info being requested is old info again from more than 10 years ago which I cannot remember anyway after not contacting me for years I receive a call from a debt collector on behalf of African Bank who pressures me so much and threatens me with legal action while these accounts had actually already prescribed every month I receive a reminder on what's app to make my payment or my salary will be garnished so out of pressure and threats I started paying the collector I am disgusted by this treatment and at this point my request is for prescription letters for both these accounts and for my credit profile to be updated right now they are offering me 30% discount on settlement really for accounts that are older than 10 years? I really need help this is greatly affecting my credit score and largely my life,1
"Nothing can be assisted over the phone! NOTHING! it is not possible for MOST people to go into the bank [who has 30 min lunch time or 45min] and be assisted (in time!) and to make it back to work. this is the Reason things like security questions exist to verify who you are talking to! so now people need to put in a day's leave, to go fix something in the bank which could have been resolved within 2 minutes over the phone! get your priorities in order African Bank! Help people over the phone... or send someone with a laptop to their work addresses if you MUST see the person! your service is pathetic!",1
"I called African Bank a few months ago to apply for a credit card. The card was approved, no one bothered to let me know that it was approved.

When I called back about two weeks later to enquire I was told that the application expired and that I needed to reapply, which I did and resubmitted all the documents again. This time I was told that the application is declined as there is a dispute warning on the credit bureaus and that I didn't qualify to apply for 3 months.

Low and behold, before 3 months is up they called again, about 2 weeks ago offering me a credit card, and I decided to take it just incase I need cash in the event if an emergency. Now they have gone all silent on me again 🤣🤣.

In this year alone they have made my credit applications unnecessarily untidy with approximately 6 enquiries.

Ive emailed them to follow up and these people just dont reply.

I'm super fed up with their nonsense. It's just horrible that no one there has tenacity to just follow through and give feedback, if it's declined again after being approved, TELL ME WHY",1

"I recently visited an African Bank branch to have  my password changed after being blocked from using the app (incorrect credentials). This, even though I’d been using the same password. And now, two days later, I’m getting the same error message when trying to log into my account. 

I’ve been to their branch for the same problem twice already. Both times consultants advice that it’s because I’d entered incorrect credentials. Which is not the case, as I’ve been using the same password (it’s in fact saved into my phones password storage). 

Is it a technical error on their hand? How do I permanently fix this because I’m unable to do transfers, let alone have any control of my money. What’s worse is that this can ONLY be fixed at their branches.",2
"I have been trying to get my late mothers closing statement as ordered by court but I was first told African bank does not release that information until I have the letter of authority (even though I need the statement to get the letter of authority) this being my first time I get my statements from all the other banks and go back to court and explain to them what African bank had said, to which I was told I have to go back to them and get the statement, I then go again explain to the consultant the consultant emails someone all the documents and says I will receive feedback within 2 days which I did only to be given a form to complete which I did complete and go into the branch ask the consultant to please help me with a few questions to which she says she also doesn’t know but let’s send it anyways along with the documents they needed with the form, a full week later I go back to the branch ask if there was any feedback as the consultant had said she would contact me when she gets feedback but she didn’t so I got to the branch she tell me she actually did get a response she just forgot about it, but the email had stated that I need to complete the questions that I had missed, but with no advise as to how, the consultant advised me to call the call centre and ask to be transferred to the deceased estate department when I did that the next morning the consultant told me that department can’t be reached on the phone I have to email them mind you I was told their emails only work internally. Now I am back at the branch waiting on the same consultant who had helped me as she is on break right now, as I type this I have been waiting for about an hour at this point, this is the hardest time of my life and you would hope the banks would help make it easy on you, but African bank is making a hard time even harder. I am soo disappointed in them, and hope no one makes the mistake of banking with them as you will be setting yourself up for complete failure, in my opinion.",1

"I went to African Bank to apply for a loan they keep on saying I am on debt review and I am not, I don't know what system they use cos other creditors can say affordability but debt review it's a big disturbing word where else you know you are not that, I went to mtn and cell c manage to get cell phones contract.

Precious has helped me this morning and she was very help full. I would recommend that you anyone can speak with Precious at any time.,4
"On the 26 and 27 August 2021, money was fraudulently transferred from my world account to some capitec account which I don't even know who it belongs to. I didn't even get the smses for some of those transactions. I then went to African Bank branch in bronkhorstspruit to enquire on the 28th August 2021, they requested I open the case at the police station and submit the affidavit and also the case no. which I did. And the submitted the case to their forensic department. 

Since then, I have been to different branches to enquire for feedback on the case and they kept telling me after 30 days I will get my money back because they have proved that indeed its fraud but now October 2021 is going by and I haven't received my money back. 
When I call the investigator Mr Kabini Jabulani who is apparently handling the case, he said he knows nothing about the 30 days feedback which I received from the Thavhani mall branch and bronkhorstspruit branch. He then promised 7 days which has elapsed and I have been contacted since. 

When opening the account, I specifically requested that no internet connections banking must be allowed in my account, yet nothing was done about it. 

I'm even afraid to use the money left in the account as it doesn't feel safe. 

Customer service is very poor, I regret opening an account with African bank. My money is not safe at all, the stuff can't even speak the same tone with regards to my case, it's different contradicting info between the investigator and the consultant.",1
"I got a call from the agents of PROFFESSIONAL COLLECTION AND INVESTMENT on the 22 October 2021 about my African bank account. I was sceptical to continue with the call as they wanted me to disclose personal information and banking details over the phone when they called me via their cell phone numbers. Then I received a call from a very rude , arrogant ,racist and self-centred STEPHANIE STRAUSS she was forcing me to make an arrangement while they called me via a different cell phone numbers, I then requested her to send me an email which has a company signature of cause, she never did. Stephanie Strauss was very rude to me and was forcing me to make that arrangement. On the 27/10/2021 the collection agent by the name of Shadrack Makondelel came to my office to make me sign the arrangement of payment while the debit order for my account is running and last payment was on the 30/09/2021, Shadrack then called his boss STEPHENIE STRAUSS who was very rude to me again and does not give you a chance to speak she was screaming at me threaten to call my boss about this matter which is against the law (POPI ACT) . I again requested her email address and she refused and told me she will report me to African Bank for refusing to sign the documents, STEPHANIE STRAUSS IS VERY RUDE AND RACIST. My manager tried to intervene to obtain the email address from STRAUSS who was very rude and refused saying that I was screaming at her Infront of the BLACK GUY that work for her . 

I was not treated with dignity at all when STEPHANIE STRAUSS threatened to disclose information to my boss about my debt. I made copies of all the documents that SHADRACK MOKONDELEL had and none of them has a letterhead from their company (2) The documents had all my information all my contact details even written in pen that they spoke to me over the phone, and I requested an email from them. So why are they coming to my workplace to harass me? She does not get to speak to people like that, I am very unhappy the way I was treated by STEPHANIE STRAUSS she is unprofessional forgetting that she is getting paid because of us.",1
Please advise why I am being charged between R500 and R900 interest a month when my account is not in arrears?? This is unacceptable as it's almost the same as my installments and the acc is not going anywhere. Please refund the interest of both accounts back to me because my accounts are not in arrears and don't see why I am being charged. I have also emailed CExperience@africanbank and all they do is let the phone ring twice then they put down.. What service is this???,1
"African bank is unprofessional, not reliable, I have a matter that was suppose to be resolved in 7 days from the 18th October still today there is no feedback from them. When I call they hang up the phones and never call back. They don't even understand their contracts, they contradict the agreement on contracts.",1
My bank account has still not been sorted out,1
"This bank is very useless, dishonest and enjoys sitting back and lazing around. I’ve applied for a credit card online on 21/10/2021. After getting a final approval, I was notified that the process takes 48 hours to finalise everything as well as having to collect the card. From then till now they’ve been asking me to constantly upload documents in different formats and still they have not sorted out the is, I’ve even visited a branch and was not able to get any assistance. Above all of this they’ve constantly been lying that they would call us back before the end of the day and still I had to request a call back.
Waiting on a response from them has now made it difficult to apply elsewhere due to the fact that this will affect my credit score.

African Bank has really wasted my time and I personally feel that they serve no purpose in this country. They should be shut down for absolute poor service.",1
"I called African Bank desperate for their help, I had to hold for 55min with no reply just talking to the machine, left message for them to call me back but they ddnt until now, why give us an option to leave messages knowing well you will not bother calling us back",1
"This has to be the worst service ever received on planet earth. A week  ago, I tried to open up a African Bank account, when i typed in my ID number I noted it was registered to some else's account. I called 7 times, the consultants ALL HUNG upon me with out any assistance. Today I went to their branch in Randburg Square and the consultant there looked at my original ID and proof of resience and referred me to Home Affairs without trying to understand or resolve my matter. The last time I checked Home Affairs does not deal with FICA documents to open up an African Bank account. It is like they just do not want clients or do not care about the few that they do have!!!

I am appalled by this kind of treatment, begging consultants to listen to you?",1
The worst bank ever .. i tried contacting them sending emails calls but no reply in regards of my account . But if u miss a payment that all operaters is available to call you this bank is giving me problems since day 1 worst,1

"African Bank's ""My World Rewards"" is an absolute joke. They are using the system to draw clients but the system management is in total shambles. In store service at the bank is wonderful, but they seem to be unable to assist with the issue. We have to make enquiries at our branch every month to be awarded what is due to us, and even a direct branch enquiry lately has no positive outcome. E-mails are never responded to, and frustration levels are through the roof. They even question the validity of their own notices to clients that qualify for a monthly reward after 10 swipes of more than R50. 00. The service provider for this programme is totally useless and clients should not have to follow up every month to get what is due to them. I have tried every possible avenue of communication only to experience the same thing the next month. Rediculous!",1
"Hi

Kindly note my husband A. Deonarain has had an account with African Bank, his balance on his settlement was R20056.77. Head office has sent the settlement letter. Cash paid of R2060 was made and an eft of R18000.00  was on the 16/10/2021. However African Bank still debited his account today of R250.00. I dont think this is been professional of them when the account has been settled. Please contact Mr A. Deonarain - **********. Also please do a refund.

Also please send a cancelation letter setting my account has been closed. My email address is ***********",1
"I will never recommend anyone to African Bank,since I have been waiting for them to update me regarding my fraud case from June..My life is stuck because you busy deducting money from my account even if I am under investigation...for how long am I suppose to wait because you said it takes 42 days...you have such a bad service",1
"Complaints Division (Karabo)... I cam to this very platform sometime last week because of the frustration of not being able to access my statements. Karabo called me back today and navigated me through the system so that I can access my statements.

I really appreciate it",5
"went to African Bank around June this year to apply for a loan, they rejected me and said I'm under debt review. I explained to them that I wasn't I've been cleared since I was placed there fraudulently from the 1st place, I gave them proof and the guy said he would call me as he had to email to their head office. He never got back to me, funny part is nedbank gave me a credit card and westbank gave me car finance. I went back to African as I really wanted to make sure I clear my name everywhere and was told the samething. Last week I received a call from them wanting to consolidate my loans, I told the lady I wanted nothing to do with them coz they failed to help me when I needed help. The lady was very nice and she asked me politely and agreed that she checks, she did and also cameback with the debt review story again, she said I should contact Trans union and ask them to update my details which I did and they said I'm not under debt review my credit score is 645 they sent a detailed report, I than called NCR and they also confirmed that I'm not under debt review, this is frustrating really and African Bank needs to sort this out urgently. I went back to the Kroonstad branch again today and found that same useless guy and he said he doesn't remember my case yet I spoke to him before and he said he would call me back, even now I asked him for a head office tel and email, when I got home I checked and he only wrote the tel no. He just can't get anything right, ****** useless and incompetent.",1
African Bank  is failing to send me a paid up letter after calling & sending emails numerous times ….i will contact the Ombudsman of Banking services if they do not contact me in 24 hours to lay a official complaint .Pathetic ref **********,1
"Pathetic service received from doing an online application each day new documents are required when we spoke to the consultants each time they verify documents were received I have sent countless emails with the same documents. We went to the closest branch where we were assisted by the branch manager, Ashley Adriaanse with such efficiency and professionalism. 7 days later and we still have the same problem with your head office looking for more documents. You have a weak link in your head office and providing terrible service where you promise a 48 hr to 72 hour service. I would appreciate that this matter gers sorted out immediately.",2
I was informed after the effect that there is a listing against my name because someone apparently tried to apply for a loan at African Bank with a fraudulent capitec bank statement. I was not made aware of this until after I went to a Capitec Branch and was advised. My bank account is stopped from early September and I cannot do anything. I have been back and forth on emails with african bank. They keep advising me to get an impersonation letter from Capitec Bank and Capitec advised that they cannot say whether I was impersonated or not as they did not deal with this. African Bank is now not getting back to me with any solution. I am so frustrated because my salary is going to paid again on the 25th and I do not have access to my account. Please please resolve this. I have done everything from my side. Have done an affidavit and sent my ID Copy as was asked,1
"I have a compliant against African Bank, you guys you don't communicate and you are not transparent with your clients, you don't even cooperate with them. 
My partner is having issues with his bank account from this organization. He tried going to multiple branches but he never got any help. He was told that his account has been frozen because they suspect fraud, he tried to cooperate with one of the consultants and they found out that there's someone who transfered money into his account with an account that is suspected for fraud. They told him to go and do an affidavit and he did that and they told him that his account will be fine within 24 hours. 24 hours pasted and nothing. Mind you this happened a day or two after he got paid. So he couldn't pay for anything like rent and he couldn't buy food. 

He went to the other branch and they told him that the guy who transfered money into his account needs to write a statement. They guy did wrote a statement and the chargers were dropped and then his account was okay after that but he never got his money back and this all happened last month after the 15th of which it's his pay date. Then this month he got paid and his account was having problems again and today when we woke up, he was trying to send money and then to our surprise the account had no funds.

Can we please get some clarity about whats going on because we can't get clarity from the bank.",1
"Nothing asked for gets done...i phoned 2 months ago to change the debit order date on my credit card, as requested from the start, I only pay the 26th, however you keep deducting before the 26th",1
"It's been One and half months that african bank has put my account on hold, I have been to the 3 times, and I have made a lot of calls to them, it still hasn't been resolved until today, I am wasting my airtime, petrol, time, and now I'm struggling cause I can't afford to buy my family and food, this is sad that a bank can just freeze your account and not assist",1
"I recently applied for a personal loan and was asked to submit supporting documents which I did. 

Today when I queried the status, I was told that they require a employment letter with particular information or details on the letter. 

If someone at the bank was intelligent enough to actually contact my employer, they would have been able to get the relevant information and process the application.

Now I have to wait until I get a response before I can try alternatives. 

I must mention that I did get great service from the first line support consultants. Great work and I hope the other department can learn something about customer service from you.",1
"Some time in August 2021 l received a call from African bank asking if I wanted a loan. As I was looking at starting my own business I saw this as a great opportunity. The application for the loan was done on line and I was asked asked to submit some documentation which I did. The loan was approved in no time. The contract process was also done online and during which I was offered an offer of a cell phone to the value of R7000. I took the offer, l was informed that the cell phone will be delivered within 4 to 10 working days. The same day the funds were released minus the cell phone amount. The 10 days passed and l decided to follow up on the cell phone. To start with they had a wrong number and they attributed that to them not being able to contact me. Mind you it was African Bank that made the initial contact, how they now have a wrong number to my account bits me. Following this l received about 3 calls from different people assuring me l would get my cell phone. The 4th call was to tell me that, the initial phone that I had chosen was out of stock and hence they were offering me another cell phone. This was a cheaper phone by R5000. I then enquired if I would get a refund of the remaining amount and the answer was no. I felt cheated and I refused the offer and indicated l would wait for the cellphone of the amount they took from me. Following this call I received 2 more calls with the same offer and each time I would refuse the offer. On the 4th call I told the operator to please cancel the order and I get the refund, to which I was informed African Bank would contact me to that effect. 2 weeks went by, no contact from African bank. I decided to send an email narrating the ordeal, no response. I then made a call to follow up, the operator who responded wanted an authentication process to be done which I have no objection to. However no sms came through, we tried the questionnaire authentication. That failed and I was told l could not get help. I am really disappointed, it was African Bank that contacted me and now I have to waste my money and time running after them to solve the problem they caused.",1
"I just like to take this opportunity to thank African Bank for the helpfulness that I have received lately. I was in a very desperate situation in my life and I was really battling with my cash flow. I was in need of some funds to get my life going. I was unable to apply for credit since there was a dispute on my credit profile with credit bureau. African Bank came into the rescue since I had an advance payment on my loan with African Bank. A portion of that advanced payment played a big role. African Bank answered my request of reverse a portion of that advanced payment. Thanks to the call center agent who escalated my plea (I forgot her name). Just for the record, it is not the first time African Bank came rescued me. At some point I was totally a mess financially until African Bank consolidated all my debts, what a relief. Not only that. At some point I was granted a payment break after requesting for one. Please continue to do what you have done to me to others as well. God bless the entire staff of African Bank, from the CEO to the staff on the ground. 

Ever since I began interacting with African Bank Staff (At Branches and Call Centre) they never disappoint. Thank you.",5
"I have been a client for many years and have gone back to them as they service use to be outstanding, now I feel like closing everything and rather opening a credit card with Capitec. I submitted an insurance claim in September 2021 for August 2021, after numerous follow ups in October 2021 they only informed me that they never received my email I resent it to them and magically they received my emails again. I was eventually notified that my claim was accepted and my accounts were credited even the debit order went through as per normal (My credit card is even 2.9K in credit). I then wanted to know how to go about to make my credit card active again as I need to use it and they informed me that I must go to the branch to activate it. I went to the branch today. after waiting for a whole hour to be served as there were two clients in front of me and only one staff member serving us, to be informed that the insurance must be phoned again as they haven't released my status by them. They were phoned and I was told I am going to have to wait another 48hours to hear if they will activate it. This after the insurance department informed me I must just go to the branch to make it active. Received a message from them now informing me my request was declined as there is a hold on my account?! How if my credit card is in a credit of almost 3K?!",1
"You need to sort your authentication process out. I would like to know what is happening with the Fraud queries which we logged on Sunday.

Answering a call and divulging all my personal details to some random person on the call is not on. Ideally  - Add a field on the call back form ' What should we say when we call you to prove its us: "" and then use that prove its a legit call.

I applied for a loan which was approved, received the contract (Account_Reference **********) ​on 11 October, approved the debicheck on Monday, was advised the loan will be paid out in 48 hours. On Wednesday I called a consultant as no funds was received. He logged a ticket (query **********72) and apologised for the inconvenience and said the funds will be paid on 14 Oct.

Until recently, For quite some time now I have been trying to access my account statements (myworld account) and have had zero success.

I aplied for a loan online on the 6th of October. I have been sent from pilar to post because of outstanding documents. Whenever I get a message about outstanding documents I upload it. 2 days ago I caled and I was told everything is fine someone will cal me to finalise the aplication. til this day I have not received a cal instead I got an sms of outstanding documents which I previously submitted. yesterday when I called to inquire I was told an email was sent to my workplace as son as they get a response they will finalise the application. Why is it such a long process to finalise this. 2 days ago the loan was read yesterday it's back to square 1. This is really inconvenient and when we apply for such loans we have emergencies. Am I going to get the loan so that if I am not getting it I can try other alternatives.,1
"The African Bank system is pathetic. I am over their system. I am not planning to use them in future for any reason whatsoever.

I am trying (with no luck) to close my African Bank loan which I have paid in full.
I have submitted everything the consultant has asked for and after 2 emails no response. 

I need this account closed urgently as no more funds are to be deducted.

The level of customer service at African Bank is pathetic to say the least. This is not the first time I have had issues with this Bank and once again find it very confusing how African Bank get awarded ""Customer Service"" awards if this is how they treat clients.

I expect a reply on my mails to confirm the account is closed.",1
"Terrible Service. Applied twice for a loan. Gets rejected due to not being able to verify my bank details. 
No call back to ask for info. When i call no one answers and if i go to the branch they say all my documents are 100% but no one can define the rejection reason.

"They do not consider certain clients with their offers. did an online application and everything approved then once required to utilize funds they later tell me that in order to access certain facilities i need to change my salary to their bank.

"I recently changed my cellphones and smartswitch would not transfer African Banks Details so I had to reinstall the African Bank Appl. I was asked to enter the username, pin and password. 
This did not work and I was told to go into a branch which I duly did. After about an hour of trying their reduculous biometric thumb system (which by the way is a joke as it never works) the assistant could still not solve the problem.

No matter what he did the appl would not give us access.  
AND NOW FOR THE JOKE. HE THEN REPORTS IT TO HEAD OFFICE WHO THEN TAKES AN UNBELIEVABLE 72 HOURS TO COME BACK TO YOU.
FOR 72 HOUR YOU ARE LEFT WITHOUT INTERNET BANKING DUE A PROBLEM ON THEIR SIDE.
This is the year 2021 and they are pathetic. Never mind that you can call them and be kept holding for up to 20 minutes and this is when they have returned your call.

THIS BANK IS A JOKE AND CLEARLY RUN BY AMATURES IN THE INDUSTRY.",1
This bank is probably one of the worst. How does anyone allow them to get away with what they do and how they treat people. Its sad to think they are oblivious to the fact thatt there is a pandemic and that some of us barely make ends meet because we sit with 1 salary not 2 anymore due to retrenchment. Food is up fuel is up i have a child to raise rent to pay etc. I have asked them countless occassions how debt outstanding can triple from the initial loan amount. They do not give me what i ask for. I need to hold this bank accountable for the suffering i am put through. Then they pitch up at my work without appointment etc embarrasing me. My debt must be writen off. How does one sue a bank for emotional damage suffered.,1

Consultant that assited me insured me that there will be extra funds to use for pvt use. No one got back to me after 48 hours. Had to phone African bank numerous times this week for an update. Today(Friday) I phoned again for an update and consultant assured me that funds will be av soon after workplace verrification. 

Funds where paid into my accounts paying off my loans but not the additional funds I requested.

I applied for a loan and was approved on the 1st of October. 7days later the money has still not been submitted into my account despite approving a debi check and submitting all documents. What is frustrating is that we take loans for specific needs and now I will miss the deadline to attend to the need because this bank is this slow. None of he consultants are able to explain why it takes that long but they all lie and say the money will reflect today each time I call them as that never happens. I shouldn’t have bothered,1
5 Days to proses an application. Customer service agent Mpho refuse to transfer me to a supervisor transferred me back to the que.,1
"Good day 

I have been booked off indefinitely due to a heart condition and have tried to reach you regarding submission of a disability claim. I have a letter from helen joseph hospital to no avail. This is putting more pressure on me and my health the fact that I am not assisted.

"Covid happened to us all, I got a couple of months behind on my card. When times got better I made a once off payment to clear the arrears and have something available. At the end of that month i even got a statement saying how much i had available. So then i deposited another lump sum, thinking im saving for when i go to the dentist. So two weeks ago i go into the branch to get a new card, and they dont want to give me one, saying my account was in arrears and the limit is not valid etc etc. So why did i get statements that says i have the same limit? i even got one this morning saying i have 10k available? But you wont give it to me african bank?? Thats not fair, thats theft!!",1
"Poor Service , holding on call for hours on end over 5 days just to get clarity on documentation required. I keep getting messages that documents are outstanding.

"I must say that i am not happy with the service I am currently getting from African bank to think that they were for me the most efficient when it comes to customer service. I paid off my loan a month ago after having called to get a settlement balance. my debit order went off for the installment instead of balance when i was refunded i was short paid. not am battling to get the difference, bearing in mind that as banks charge interest everyday when you owe them. I won't be paid interest from the date i have been waiting to get the rest of my refund back. not treated fairly as loyal customer.",1
I like to thank Samuel Letageng from the media department for resolving my query. He is so professional and friendly. I wish all african bank employees were like him. Thank you so much Sam,5

"I logged an atm dispute on 7th September 2021. I drew money from an Absa ATM never received the money and received a slip to indicate that the money would be reversed. Called ABSA the next day and they advised that I speak to my bank (African Bank) and lodge a dispute with them.

It is a month later and after numerous call to African bank, I have not received my money and not even a response from the bank to let me know how far they are with my query. 

Every time I call,  all I'm constantly told is that the query is pending investigation.",1

"On the 1st of October I went to African bank Centurion to invest money for my children.  It was R10 000 cash into a Tax Free account.  When the machine count the money it only adds up to R4350.  An incompetent person from the bank, put the machine of to restart and the whole transaction was gone.   I was sitting in the bank for 2 hours and they could not give me answers as to how the money will reflect in my account.  They promised me it will be in my account withn 72 hours.  It is the 5th now today.   5 days later.   I went back to the bank.   Still they cant give me an answer if the money was allocated.  Surley when they cashed up on the 1st there was a surplus in their cash???    The only answer I could get from them??  ""Please come back on Friday??""   Which takes us to 8 DAYS without tracing my money??   I used to work in a bank, and know the system.   Obviously there was a surplus of R5650 when they cashed up on the 1st of October??   I am NOT happy with their service AND IT IS NOT PROTOCOL TO WAIT 8 DAYS to look for money in their system??

"Absolutely terrible service from this place. I applied for a loan on the 20th of september. Added all the required docs. And waited. Then i called them every day total 29 calls to date. And no one could give me a answer as to why it was taking so long. My application was escelates 7 times with no one contacting me. Requested call backs twice and no one ever called. Went to the branch and couldnt be helped. Only to log in thia morning and there ia no application. Phoned again and they cant even see there was a application.

How do you run a company where the customer has to do the work of customer service. Why must i follow up every day? Why do you make promises and not keep them. Why do your agents lie to the customers? And why dont you honor your callbacks? What ia the point of escelation if nothing happens? You just twll the customer bs to let him off the call and dont worry at all about if you actually helping them? I literaly declined offers from other banks  because i already applied with you. I doubt you will even respond to this. But this is the worst company i have ever dealt with and will make sure i tell EVERYONE to NEVER do any business with you",1

I have been in a financial bind and and made new arrangement with African Bank regarding my Loan and Credit card. African Bank agreed on the new payment arrangement. Come end of month the debt my account with the new arrangemnet and also still took the old paymebts aswell. Now i am paying double the installments after they said they will only take the new payment as arranged with them. Thus putting me in a greater bind. African Bank is that the rite way of doing things. Now i dont have money to live on because you are stealing from me..,1
Guys do we always have to adl for a better service every month? Really i personally feel like you should just close your rewards services because it's the only thing that makes you different and yet the department sucks!! Stop advertising yourself as a better bank than all the banks in SA because you are not!!!??,1

"I am so disgusted by this company towards the elderly. They rob our mothers. I went to Trade route mall branch in Lenz yesterday to help my 66 year old Aunt renew her expired credit card. She received a message for renewal about 2 months ago, it did not specify when to renew. The card expired yesterday 30 September 2021. When we got to the branch, they charged her R150 because she was supposed to come on the 1st of October. Mind you she lives in Prote glen Soweto and she is sickly, i have to fetch her every month-end to help her pay bills and groceries. I still do not understand why they did not specify on the message or why is there no exception when it comes to the elderly. It made no sense to me and i am very dissapointed at how African bank deals with their customers. R150 for card renewal because she renewed her card on the day it expired instead of the following day after it expired, thats insane and daylight robbery.",1

They told her to get a police affidavit,made a copy of her id,then they told her that the amount was withdraw by a pocket card as she was using MY world,it means they ere transferring her money from my world to That pocket card that I don't even know how it's working,then they withdraw

I applied for a personal loan with African Bank yesterday 22 September 2021. I was approved the amount. I sent through all my documentation as well. I was advised to accept all the terms online.

"Dear African Bank

Dealing with you has been a frustrating experience. I have now spoken to 4 consultants, making arrangements to sort out my arrears and make payment towards the account. I have made an arrangement with the first consultant, who then was supposed to send me my easypay number and never did. The same with the other 3. Yesterday, a consultant phoned again and again I had made an arrangement, she said that the notes say I have been putting the phone down, yet I know that I have been speaking to consultants, 4 to be exact. I have mentioned previously that I am not allowed to take private calls or answer my cell phone at work. However, this despite making arrangements I have been called continuously and now on my work phone as well. Please will replay the calls made to me and it will show you the arrangements made on the accounts. This has been most frustrating. I am not allowed private calls at the office and the only times I can talk is on my way to work which is when I spoke to 4 consultants. Please do not phone my office as if I am fired I will have no money to pay you back.",1
"About 2 to 3 weeks ago, I applied for a small loan from African Bank. Online. Due to covid damage and the very remote area I am living in, I wasnt very optimistic. Constant power failures, unrest, traveling issues, connection problems and demand of my work, made it almost impossible to to achieve. Yet, the tenacity, super proffesionalism and curtecy of African Bank, this goal was achieved. Two people in particular, I want to mention. Melvin and Margaret. Their intelligence and empathy are commendable. Their is no lack of sincerety and dedication. Regardless whether I gave up, they percisted. Bank by the people for the people. I salute you",5
Applied for a loan with African Bank on the 17th sent my documents 3 times on that day and still kept getting a message that I must send the documents. I went to the branch on Saturday gave the consultant all the documents even did a Debi check and was email the policy documents. Left the branch and got a message to say I must resend my documents. Till doday still getting the same message and I am being told they are doing a affordability check since Friday. The call centre is of no assistance even the branch. Why offer loans when your process is so inconsistent and delayed.,1
"I have applied for a loan with African Bank on the 17th September and it was approved, I accepted Debi check and received a contract stating how much will I be paying every month. Few hours later I received an sms saying that my application was unsuccessful.  When I called the branch that assisted me, they said it was a system error",1
"Its been a couple of days and still I haven't received any feedback from African Bank. It just goes to show they don't give a **** about their consumers.

Over the past weekend I received multiple sms's from them saying I again qualify for the rewards at the end of the month. Same old **** different month.

African bank should just tell its consumers that the rewards system is a scam if its not they should check their employees who probably uses the customers vouchers! 

Sick and tired of running up and down to retrieve a voucher that says invalid every time I try using it! I have never been so embarrassed in my life! 

I don't recommend anyone to use this bank! Unprofessional and cannot be trusted!",1
"I took out a loan on 21 August but ended up paying the entire amount on 02 September. When I queried why there was still a balance, I was advised it is the Settlement amount. I paid this on 09 September. I can see on the App that the Account Info shows Settled but there is a small amount of R1.91 on the account. I have now called numerous times without answer, when requesting a call back it does not work. Please can this account be closed, it is impacting negatively on my Credit Report.",2
"Well, firstly African bank your customer service is pathetic!!
You never answer your customers.
This month there is actually another problem as well.
I have a my world account with African bank and there are a selection of rewards you can get if you swipe your card ten times. Well, some of them work and some of them don't work.  For instance, I can't use the uber eats voucher as it is not compatible with Uber eats. When you come to pay, you can't use it as an option. This is very frustrating as this is R150 down the drain, this is the second time it has happened to me.
So I emailed the bank on Tuesday, the rewards section and it is now Friday and I am still waiting for them to give me a reply.
They replied and then I replied with my query further and since Tuesday I am still waiting for an answer.

This is not poor service, this is terrible service, I like getting the checkers/shoprite voucher but this was not on the list this time, so the only other voucher where you can get groceries is the uber eats voucher, but it never works!!!!",1
"Dear African Bank

I have had made 3 arrangements with 3 consultants. Each consultant says the arrangement has been made. The next day a consultant phones me again to make the same arrangement because the previous consultant did not record it. This has happened 3 times and I see the number still coming through on my phone. Please note that I cannot be taking calls 5 times a day to make the arrangement over and over again. We are not allowed to take private calls and it seems that the consultants there are not doing their jobs. This is the most frustrating part.",1

I am really not impressed at all and should my account be debited on the 20th I will take this matter to lawyers ,  because I settled my loans on the 10th don't understand why its still opened while I even sent proof of payments so the account can closed",1
This is the worst experience I have ever had. There is absolutely no customer service at all at African Bank. I am absolutely livid and extremely disappointed with the run around at this so-called financial institution. I have been waiting for over 2 weeks for just confirmation on my application. I was offered a credit amount and accepted it but 48 hours later and still nothing then I get a call from Samworth and he says that employment is still to be confirmed. How is this possible?,1
"I have been dealing with a credit card application since the 09/09/2021. Today, I called the call centre as per the banking app and was told to collect my card as all had been done. Today I go into the branch and they have NO RECORD of my details to collect the card or that the application has been approved. It's really just such terrible service. Honestly. It was the worst mistake even applying with African bank.",1
"Online application was finally processed after having to request call backs to get direction on the website, as the application directs to a page where you have to either log in or register. I had a loan with African bank more than 10 years ago and settled, and had my previous cell number registered with them on the previous contract...again more than 10 years ago. I could not register nor log in as my cell number could not be linked to my ID number. I was transferred to the service department where they advised that I would have to go into a branch to fix this issue. I explained that it is impossible for me to go to a branch for very reasonable reasons. Again, I was called to complete loan application and was told that it is a telephonic binding contract and the contract was concluded via the call. Consultant then advised everything was completed for loan application, but I would have to go to the branch to have my biometrics done, and again I had to explain that I cannot go to the branch. Consultant then advised that my loan application, which was completed, could be either incomplete or terminated due me not being able to go to a branch. Where is humanity in all of this? What about the terminally ill people who cannot go outside their home, to think of all the people who lives hundreds of kilometres away from a branch, being unable to go to 'the nearest branch' So many unaddressed, unchanged issues within a brand, has me wondering if the bank ever hear of COVID, where many companies HAD to change their internal policies to suite the needs of their market, young and old. Does African bank know that everyone has gone digital and could simplify things with a few changes? Customer centricity is not at focus at all, and all the consultants could not escalate this, as I would think they are trained to be robotic and lay down the laws only.African bank, you've let me down, from where you have started, to now..you have back slided in your internal processes. IF businesses are not customer centric, who then do they cater to? Very disappointed, worried and dissatisfied customer. #treatingcustomersfairly policy does not exist here.",2
"I am not working ever since the lotting and i asked them to give me 50% of my account to close its since i have no job,but they refuse and they dont care about they customers at all,they only care about money",1

"In January 2021, I was retrenched and contacted African Bank. Submitted all the retrenchment documents, following day I received an sms stating that my claim was rejected. Now am confused as I keep receiving calls from them with different numbers, asking me to make payment arrangement or they give me an offer to settle the loan on a specific date. In proper common sense will I stop paying my loan if I was still working. Come on African Bank, this is why we take out insurance whenever we take out loans, to assist us in times like these.",1
"If it were up to me I'd give 0 star
African Bank is the worst, poor service poor everything.
My mom and I have been struggling to get our money as we requested an early withdrawal as we needed the money for an emergency, guess what we finalized everything till it was time to recieve the funds, dololo nothing. When we webt back they told us the account has a red flag and they're investigating fraud🚩. Duh!
That was 3 weeks ago, till now. Last week they spoke to capitec Bank and it was indeed confirmed that I made payments to my moms account and I have proof, duh!
Now that they have found that proof they're ignoring us and blocking us on Facebook, Imali dololo. Scam bank! And they're consultants are rude!
Last week we laid a complaint, if they don't solve this God help them!
I'm ready to take legal action and so Is my mother (account holder).
My life is on hold, I have even lost the builders who were waiting for me to buy building material 2 weeks ago. Now I am stranded coz of this pathetic bank.
I hate African Bank and I curse the day I invested with them.
We're coming for you and you'll be sorry coz I'll even sue you for the stress you caused me.",1
"I applied for a loan on the 6th of September and after a week of sending documents over and over again today I get an offer from them, accept everything even got a debicheck mandate only for them to say sorry you do not qualify.

I am not mad that it was declined im mad because why keep me hanging for a week and have me send documents multiple times and then make me a offer to only say sorry you do not qualify.

Hipocrates if you ask me only wasting your time!!",1
Worst bank ever branch staff get paid for nothing all they ever advise you of is the call center one takes time out to visit the branch in hopes to get issues resolved and yet you always being reffered to the call center for assistance and the call center is always offline its so frustrating having to deal with such incompitance at this day and age African  Bank worst bank ever for sure.,1
I had a bad experience recently and i am still in shock because they transferred my funds without my knowledge and i am seeking it to be given back to me.. I cannot loose money...,1
"Once again I'm having issues with African Bank MyWorld Rewards. I called the call centre and was told I didn't swipe 10 times for the month and I literally had to tell them to check my bank statement as I swipe more that 10 times every month! I was then put through to the rewards centre, the guy who assisted me was so friendly and helpful only to con me by sending me a invalid rewards voucher. This is not the first time this is happening to me! African bank has embarrassed me a few times already with their non working vouchers! Im definitely thinking of moving to Capitec, been hearing their praises while I've been complaining about my bank! When I called them back to let them know the voucher they sent me was invalid they apparently couldn't put me through to their rewards centre and told me I'll receive a call from them but its been a week and still haven't received a call! To think I used to tell people to move to African bank because of their costs but their service sucks! So I'd rather pay a small fee and get proper customer care.",1
"This is frustrating doing a online application if your system is always unavailable, it took me 2weeks to do a online application then i get msgs saying i did not submit all my docs when the system shows the credit docs but when i want to go further it shows temporary unavailable.

"I am from Tembisa. I went to Kempton park to collect my child’s bank card and when I got there it was 16:50. The bank closes at 17:00. Modiba Makai( I’m not sure if she gave me the correct name because she was not even wearing her name tag) told me straight up she closed. I tried to reason with her to show I’m on time, I’m from work, all the way from Tembisa and it’s just to collect the bank card but she did not hear any and she closed the door in front of my face. Why would it write that the bank closes at 5pm when the workers decide their own time to close? Please help",1
"Delays with credit card application. I applied the week of the 3rd of September- I was initially very impressed with the TATs. I received a call to go through the terms and conditions, instalment etc on Saturday the 4th of September. I was advised that it would take 48 hours for disbur*****t and thus collection of the card I presumed. On the 4th I also received my credit agreement, credit life info etc. Today the 13th of Sep, no further updates. I contacted the call centre and was advised I just need to be patient. Her advise was that I should think of 48 hours as 8 hours per day, as that's working hours.",1
Went into the branch to apply for a credit card. With all my documents. Called the call centre countless times to confirm the documents are in order. They are getting confused with my documentation and no one is even bothering to call to confirm anything.,1
"A whole week waiting on a credit card, no one calls you back as promised. They say they escalating but if I don't phone or go into the branch I don't hear anything. The worst service ever and they should stop false advertising same day feedback, 24 hour payout what a joke",1
"The branch in Paarl is has some very friendly service and the MyWorld account itself is actually one of the best savings accounts you can currently get, thats my opinion at least. The app still requires some improvements but is not too bad just a bit slow.

Let's get to the worst part though, applying for a credit card... A pure disaster if you ask me, i just thought it might be good to have a secondary credit card that i can leave with a positive balance since you get around 3% on your money per year.

At first year of birth was wrong so i kept on getting a ""no offers could be generated"", turns out the 01 on my ID reflected on their side as 1901 instead of 2001 so I was technically too old to qualify for a Credit card. After numerous phone calls they fixed it and i got a decent enough offer which looked like it got approved and I went to fetch my Card. 

Apparently that was not the end, after getting the card they still had to do a final review and after 3 days of waiting with a useless piece of plastic in my wallet the application got declined LOL. This was the funniest thing i have ever seen normally when you get your card that's it, they wasted my time by letting me fetch a card in town which i had to throw away in the end. Turns out i got declined because they couldn't verify my employment, this was due to my place of work not having a landline number unfortunately they don't accept cell business numbers.

At this point I almost gave up but i thought let me go the branch and lets try to fix the problem. Had to reapply for credit card and get proof of employment from my boss, also a reason why there is not landline number on our premises ( there are no telephone cables due to the location which is sort of in the middle of the mountains why this has to be explained to a bank i really don't understand).

Have not got an outcome yet but let's see how it goes if i get declined again for any reason that i find unfair I am definitely closing my account. They have already added far too many unnecessary enquiries to my credit record due to their incompetence.",3
"BAD, BAD, BAD EXPERIENCE. Apply for finance and you will receive countless calls from them and you have to keep repeating yourself for every call you receive its like they don't have notes or communicate internal then again after being asked to come through the branch for fingerprint verification which I don't understand WHY because they claim you can do everything on their so called website.  Ok I went there did fingerprints now they went quiet on me for DAYS and still I have to call again, made to hold for more than 30min with my own airtime only to be told my application was canceled by whom I don't know, there Consultants don't even know other branches numbers and they even advise you not to go to the branches because your application will be cancelled even if you qualify so clearly there bunch of *****s don't know what they are doing and I'm going to let everyone know how incapable and unprofessional you guys and your disgusting service is....NXP",1
"I am frustrated by the service and lack of competency experienced with African Bank, I had a loan with them and had a garnishing order deducted from 2009 - 2012, when i called them for my paid up letter April of 2012 years later received notice that there is an outstanding amount. I called them to find out what the amount was for as they were paid up no one was able to explain. However i had a debt collector come to my office and aggressively want me to sign payment arrangements,i provided him with the salary slips of my account been paid up. I heard nothing further. again after years i received a statement, when i called them they advised that the account was with them but still could not inform me what the amount was for, now i have received from a debt collection company, i forwarded once again my proof that the account was paid up, and she informed me that she has disputed my account and waiting on an answer. When calling African Bank i was asked if i wanted a bank account with them, really what horrible service and messing with my credit record. I would never in a lifetime recommend their service to anyone.",1

I have been transferring funds every month to my world; now, I can't even transfer the funds to an investment account. I have to the banks twice, spending more than two hours each time trying to access the account. The call centre refers me to the branch. The branch always says we can't assist.  Let call the call centre as you are not the account holder.  I have also been calling the call centre for hours and being transferred to a different person, spending more than 1 hour.  I decide to close the account to withdraw all the funds from my world and investment account.

I have been a struggle for the bank to transfer these funds to his other account. I have called the the so many times the call centre.",1
I made a loan application and it was approved and i got my contract. They called me on Monday to confirm the loan and when payment will happen. I even acceted a debit order mandate on my bank.

Since my complaint about African Bank to date no response received from African Bank. Will not advise anyone to be their client/customer.,1
"Am Very disappointed with African Bank (ABIL). I had 2 fixed deposits with ABIL maturing within days of each other. I Was convinced by ABIL to combine the 2 into one Access Accumulator A/C, where I would get an effective interest rate of 6,94% that increases monthly by 0,15%. for a period of 24 months. On my first statement I noticed the interest was a lot lower than expected, and I inquired at the branch what was going on.  I was then told the starting rate is only 4,8%, -  that increases to a max of 6,94% of the 24 month period. I was also told there was a debit order for 40 days on this a/c and I could only get the full amount after 40 days. At NO stage was the rate of 4.8% ever mentioned. Even on all the documentation and agreements 4.8% starting is never stated. Only 6.94% appears. (Including my 1st statement.) Will definitely close this A/C ASAP.",2
"I applied for a credit card on 23/08/2021. Till to date I dont have an answer. My problem is been escalated every 2nd day. I spoke to a Supervisor named Sipho Ramashiya.

"I applied for a loan on 30 August 2020. Got approved sent all my docs via email. No response.  Went to Brooklyn Branch twice.  Saturday the system was off went back on Monday and even open up a bank account.  

Lady at branch did 'n credit mandate for the premium to go on the 25th.  She said the money will be in my bank account with in 24 - 48 hours.  Up till now no money recieved.  So I phoned Brooklyn Branch lady confirmed that my work number is not correct.  When I asked her what number is on the system she told me she cant see it and that I must sms it, and in 48 hours someone will phone me back.

Nobody has come back to me regarding this.  Previously i did business with African bank and the service was not like this.  THIS IS VERY DISSAPOINTING!!!!!",1

Went into a branch to find the employees sitting on the couches chatting and also not being any help just saying if I uploaded everything I must wait for feedback.

I dont understand what the problem is as my payslip is not unclear at all and I have uploaded it in 3 different formats.

"I have 2 7 days notice investment accounts with them and I withdrew from 1 of them for the first time last month but the service I got from the head office consultant who was responsible for approval and confirming the reasons for early withdrawal was terrible. As that wasn't enough, I have made a full notice withdrawal on the first of September and did several follow ups thereafter because I urgently needed the money  for my sick child's hospital bill and still do. Guess what to date I still haven't received the funds in my account as promised and my son has to miss check up because I have no money to pay the doctor, get him to the hospital or even get him medication. I had opened a 7 days notice investments for such emergencies but I am not getting any joy from their service champions.

"Hi
My name is Piet Tshobi Mahlangu
I have a problem with this company,I tried to be calm but what I see is a very bad service from African bank,last week Monday I received texts saying my world account has a negative balance while it wasn't and it also stated that if is an error I must ignore the message.
I did ignore the the text as I saw it is an error,the text also said if I don't fix the negative balance it will be closed in 14 days.
On Friday I requested a withdrawal on one of my brokers without checking anything as I know my cards are working just fine.

Later only to find out that my main card is closed for no reason.

I contact call center on Saturday they fixed that account but the money I withdrawal from my broker wasn't there.on Monday I checked again no money again.

I contacted the customer center they told me to send them proof of payment,I requested a proof of payment on my broker they sent it to me.on Tuesday I sent that proof to them no respond, yesterday I contacted the call center again they give me email to sent the proof,I send again no respond.i was reading peoples reviews here people are right this agents doesn't respect their jobs they are lazy and rude and also not helpful to their customers.

This airtime we spend calling them we are not getting it for free and this isn't my mistake to suffer so much.

African bank you are a bad financial service with no good customer base you need to fire those agents and start rebuilding your business",1
"STAY AWAY !! My wife approached this financial institution for a personal loan , she was looking for X amount but they said she qualifies for Y amount which was a little bit higher . Upon receiving all documentation she would have the Y amount in her bank account within 24 - 48 hours . Day 2 they said the marriage certificate was not readable and it must be resent , Day 3 the 3 month bank statement was not readable and it must be resent , Day 4 her salary statement was not readable and it must be resent , Day 5 the application will now expire . Upon inquiring the branch in Somerset West  said that she now does not qualify due to their NEW system and she must reapply after 5 days . How the F&^%k is it possible that you qualify for a larger amount than you anticipated for the loan and then they tell you that you do not qualify anymore , how is it possible that with all the technology around that your documents are unreadable , who's fault is it that the application has now expired? Absolutely a disgrace to be called a financial institution , rather stick to the big guns such as FNB , Standard bank , Nedbank & ABSA , these institutions have the capacity to fulfill your needs not like this institution that does not know how to either send or to receive important documentation.",1

I have experienced a very bad service with African Bank. I had aoan application since the 1st of September 2021 and it's been sitting on the same status ever since. I made follow up everyday and had been told 1 thing but what is boring they can't transfer you to the department that is dealing with your loan application. I have been complaining and all they say sorry we escalating and it's been escalated for more 4times with no respond. If it was other banks they would have responded that it's approved or declined immediately or within 24hrs. On this they said it is approved but went to final offer but no response till now. What a bad empty promise.,1

I am so speechless about this they must just close thats all ,😡😡😡😡",1
"African Bank are probably thee most useless when it comes to servicing their customer. I applied for a credit card after THEY called me to request I take one out this was one WEEK AGO! there false advertising say that it will take 5 minutes for approval. I get SMS's on a daily basis saying that they will be in contact with me soon, also everyday goes by I get nothing. I've called their contact center everyday and I get promised that they would get back to me everyday which they dont. African Bank are a bunch of liars, who know nothing about service. I contact there customer service which was even worse, I'm still waiting for feedback. JESUS HELP YOU GUYS.

Pathetic and useless company, no wonder you aren't one of the big names in the market.",1

"I have a loan with them and have been unemployed since May. They contact me every day, at least 4-5 times a day telling me how much I'm overdue and asking when I make payment. I keep telling them I'm unemployed and can't make any pay, they keep asking if I can't make at least a R50, or R100 payment! HOW? I'M UMEMPLOYED WITH NO UIF! How stupid to ask such a question when a customer has just told you that they have NO income! Today's call the agent that contacted me was so rude and kept arguing with me! It's really upsetting, I'm already under stress not having any income and then keeping these calls about money owed. I know I owe money but there is nothing I can do about it until I'm employed again and earning a income. I'm not running away from my payments I just can't make them. And to phone clients so many times a day and tell them the same things is frustrating, no wonder people stop answering their phones after a time as you keep having to repeat yourself with the same story to every agent that phones you! Really a majority of South Africans are going through financial strain at the moment and can't afford to make payments.",1

We are really annoyed that you can give a client a card and then they have to wait almost a week for the funds to be deposited and when you contact them they say the same thing the application is pending but yet we received a final over and there is a verbal contract that was finalised.

Please assist us to get this matter resolved as we have the recordings and we have been patiently waiting be cant wait any more.

Why am I debited twice not once and when you call no one answers can you please rectify the mistake and Stick to one date not twice and can someone call me to rectify this,1
"Service by agent was extremely good. BUT there is a catch. African bank lures people to do a loan application by sending them an sms stating that a loan of R250 000 has been pre approved. Only to inform the applicant once they contact African bank that they will do the application and get back with an offer. 
African bank do a hard enquiry on the persons credit check at the credit bureau affecting the clients credit score and disabling that person for n period of time to apply for ANY credit. They then call back with a ridiculous offer. The sms send by African bank generates high hope with clients only to find that it is not the case. Crippling the consumers credit score.",1
I am very disappointed in African Bank's response to my query. My account has been blocked due to FICA. Now I have complied with all outstanding documents and sent them on 30/08/2021 I was informed that the turn around time is 72 hours. Today's the 03/09 /2021 and all they could tell me is that they are 'escalating' the issue. It is appalling that they can not resolve the problem why do I have to call in almost every day to follow up. I do not like to be ignored. I have never had an issue with African Bank before.

I made arrangement for the outstanding amount and honored the arrangement.  In 2018 I decided to draw a credit report and what a shock I had....African Bank had a judgement placed on my name wothout me knowing!!! I have been calling and speaking to different people and up to date no one can provide me with answers. I have been paying and paying and ot just dont seem like this account will ever be settled!! When asking for a settlement amount the amount is more than the outstanding balance....hoe is that even possible, because according to my knowledge all the ""arrears"" interest has been paid up.

Come 29 July i call the bank again and i ask again for the balance to clear my loan, got the outstanding to settle and settled immediately while i had the consultant online and all was sorted or so i thought as everything had even been cleared from the banks app which i use. 

28 August debit order comes off for the monthly installment i was normally paying i go on to check the bank app and it was now showing i have an outstanding amount of R135.11 and there is a bank statement also that appears breakdown shows R 2.16 of arrears interest the rest is service fees, vat & insurance costs.

Their service is excellent and they always willing to provide help. I've been with them for sometime and even though I lost my job their insurance still continuing paying on my behalf monthly. Without their assistance it would be more difficult for me. I thank you African Bank and keep on serving the people with your high level of service. Your app is easy to use.,5

"In April 2021 I was offered an opportunity to decrease my installment. The consultant who called to propose this offer ill informed me and provided details that were not correct. The subsequent result was my loan account falling into significant arreas. I was not impressed at all because I had set out this year to #WIN and clear my debt. Upon writing a review on this platform a consultant called me and was courteous to apologise and thoroughly go back on my account and detail how I had been misinformed. As a result of the polite and very honest and truly apologetic way she handled the issue, offering if there was anything that could be done including an investigation into the matter my upset at the instistution was quelled. It was a realisation that sometimes the institution is put into disrepute by people who are not dedicated to their position and have no concern and regard for the consumers. However one persons mishap can be undone by a dedicated consultant. At the end of the call I informed her I would not infact request the investigation but because of the way she handled the situtation I will endeavour to clear the arreas and not let it impact my experience of the institution that is AfricanBank. Thank you to that consultant. The bank really had tried to make sure that as a consumer I was cared for under these trying times of covid19. We keep at it and I am still able to #WIN by decreasing my debt at the institution. ",5
Thank you to African Bank on their great service from the various interactions I have had with them and how they resolve issues on those rare occasion as I hardly have issues with them. This is a great bank indeed! ,5
"This is not to commend African Bank but to honour Ms Yvonne Matlhaela who is an employee of African Bank. I have been waiting for over 4 weeks for feedback with regards to a paid up letter from the bank and spoke to three different consultants pertaining to the matter, who had all promised that I would be receiving the letter, to no avail. I called the bank and within a matter of minutes Yvonne had sent me the letter and I understand that there are processes in place and that it might take a certain amount of time for such a letter to be generated. However, I am of the view that you should keep a client in the loop - let them know that you are still working on sending the letter - le them know that you have them in mind even when you do not have a resolution right away. Yvonne was not only professional but she apologized in a manner that felt sincere to me and with her empathy and people skills, I vote her for African Bank President!!! ",5
"First they blocked my card, while there are funds available, then a day later send me a message that it has been reactivated. When I go to the ATM it swallows my card saying it is a stolen card.

Application was first made on the 03 August 2021. Sent and uploaded all required documents. They called and told us to go to the branch.  Got to the branch, worse experience, the lady could also not assist! Told us to just wait as it is being reviewed!! The next day the application expired and I was told to reapply!! 
I then re-applied on 18 August, sent all requested documents as well as uploaded them on their website
According to their system the application is still being reviewed and if they make an update on their site, its to request the same documents over and over again!!! 
This is now the 10th time that I am uploading and sending the same requested documents to them

African Bank is definitely a Bank that you must just once pop in to, promise you, you might just open a account, just to experience people really caring about you. I thought to myself, ok, let's see how good they really are, phoned there call centre with the knowledge that I will have to wait for Monday to get done what I was going to ask. Still in shock, the friendly women that helped me, just said, sir let's give it atleast a try and unbelievably she sorted my problem out. This is not everyday that someone get 5 stars from me.

Outstanding customer service. And a bank that truly listens and understand their customers. Thank you for your service and I will definitely be using your bank in future. ,5
"Good sir or madam

I am deeply frustrated and disappointed in the way Capitec is failing to assist me.
 Between 3rd or 4th June 2021 I received a bank notification that a purchase was made. I did not receive any message to authorize such payment. When I visited the nearest branch and explained. My card was canceled and received a new card. I was also provided with the call reference number.
 They explained the process that the investigation will be launched. Money was refunded into my account 20 - 25 days later. Then again, 16th August 2021. 
The same amount with no OTP authorization was made to my savings account. This time leaving my bank balance with a negative amount.
 Luckily, it happened during office hours and I was able to get to the nearest branch to report this matter. I was given a new reference number, the following day. 
The bank made an internal transfer to on of my savings plan in order to close the negative balance without calling me.

 Again I went to the bank, they told me that it was part of process. Since then. Then I called customer service to check on update. I was told that the purchase made was to be delivered at a different destination. No one ever called me back to give me update.

Please do intervene. There's no security to our accounts, the bank that I once trusted is truly failing me.

Good Day,

I am not happy because you guys didn't provide me with the right contract for the R24 526.74. You are giving the same  contract that I have for the money that was transferred to my bank account.That shows that some did a fraud when i was applying that why the person did want me to read the contract. This is a contract that i did receive long time ago and you guy send me the same contract it does balance with anything i  think now is the time for me to go and report african bank to omnibus because you have the proof african bank keep on giving me the wrong contract the don't have the proof that I did apply for the loan before someone from African bank who was helping when I came to apply for the loan he/she did a fraund with my name make that I applied for for R45800 and I was having a loan that I was owing and the settle that loan was I ask for the proof of that loan african bank does not have it and the loan number is ********** that is the loan that they say settle but they will not don't have the contract of that loan because I want to see the signature on that loan they keep on giving me loan number : **********02 that is the wrong one now i am going to me sue african bank

I submitted the confirmation letter on day 4 early the morning. Still not receiving feedback I went back online to see that my application expired. I phoned them yesterday to enquire what was going on and they informed me that I need to re-apply. I refused since this was not my problem.

"Good day,
I'm hoping somebody from African Bank will respond with proper feedback. My mom had a facility with African bank and in May she went into debt review. African bank kept on deducting money even after the arrangement had been made through Debtbusters. on the 26th June 2021 i even helped her send an email to Insurance Claims and ABDocs email addresses for African Bank. That was based on the instruction from the branch we called based in Protea Gardens. My mom then went to the Southdale branch on the 30th July 2021 as no feedback was received. She was promised that the refund would be in her account the following Monday. She went back on the 3rd August 2021 to the Southdale Branch to enquire and was told that they can see the refund on the system and it is being processed. She then went back on the 5th August 2021 and was then told by Jeffrey Mashoka that it would take 72 hours for the refund to be processed. Here is where it get shocking. Jeffrey told my mom that according to African Bank 72 hours is calculated based on the hours they work. In essence this equates to 11 days? Never in my life has 72 hours been calculated in this manner. Can someone please resolve this as it is negatively impacting her financially and the fact that she is on an oxygen machine and cant keep getting my dad to drive her around to resolve this matter. Decide what 72 hours means and communicate properly with your customers. Don't take advantage of them because they are old and frail. You are also more than welcome to contact me if you see fit. ",1
"Dear African Bank and South African Banks, I want to settle my account with African Bank, i requested for a quote from African Bank, the Balance is less than the Settlement amount. They said if I settle my account the is a charge on it.  It does not make sense as to how can the settlement amount be higher than the balance it should be the other way around. I asked the consultant what is this charge for, she could not give me an answer. I want to know what is the fee charge for and why is the settlement amount higher.

The settlement amount should not be higher as the interest that was calculated with the loan term you took should lapse.

The balance amount should already be including the interest for the term of the loan.

I am not happy with the current situation as i would like to pay off this loan and never to take a loan with with you it seems you bind people to a loan and to make sure we pay the full term settling the loan or not.

I will be taking this matter to the banking Ombudman.

I am not happy and i will not take a loan with you or invest my money with your Bank in the future.

Loan Account Number is **********. I have already paid back R32 800, i took a loan of R45 000 and my settlement is still in the thirty thousand this absolutely nonsense.

I was informed to send the relevant documents to their email address.  Not having payslips the consultant CONFIRMED THAT A COMPANY LETTER will suffice.  Loading all the documents on the system went easy, only to receive an email back saying the require payslips.  I mailed back explaining what the consultant had said, with NO REPLY.  The evening still no developments, only an sms stating i required payslips.  I asked the company to supply me with payslips and have them stamped.  This was uploaded yesterday.  I tried calling the call centre, only to eventually put down the phone.  Called again, requested a call back.  The system called me back, and put me on hold for another 25 minutes.  I left it at that hoping that today there would be an outcome, NOTHING.  Again called and called and held on and held on, finally getting hold of ANOTHER consultant, who tells me to check at 13h00 there will be an offer there.  Time is now almost 15h00, the status on the app and internet banking still remains the same.  Application being reviewed we will get back to you SHORTLY.  Wow...When will i have a response?  ",1

"I’m a deeply disappointed about the service I received from African Bank.The bank is currently running a rewards promotion and I haven’t received the rewards entitled to me. 

I swiped 10 times and I received a sms stating that I qualified to receive a voucher from Shoprite and I will receive it end of the Month which was June 2021. I  never received that voucher and I have been calling the rewards department, and I have been sent from pillar to post with customer service agents from one agent promising that the issue has been resolved ,to the next agent from rewards department Denise ,who has never updated me on the status of my case.

It is unfair of African Bank to run a promotion competition with false advertising which ends up frustrating their clients when they can’t deliver in their side.
People should stick to other banks like Capitec Bank who keep there end of their deal!!!!!!!!!

"At the branch Verulam, assisted by Sihle. Their systems were beyond slow, took a day off from work  to apply for credit. It was frustrating I was there from 9 and finished afer 12. She told me before we start that the system are slow and I saw some customers leaving the branch because it was bad. She was very patient with me,as much as I was inconvenienced by your systems but she was of great help. Big up to her ?",3
Im honestly not happy with the service im getting from African Bank. Did a loan application on Tuesday morning and i was told the turn around time is 24 to 48hrs. Sent all documents and yesterday i was told that they are busy reviewing my documents. Today when i called im being told that u require my 3months bank statement which was sent,2
I did a credit check and I found out that I owe African bank a Student Emergency loan that I took in 2008 when I try calling them to find out who took that loan no one is giving me a straight answer yet it appears on my credit report,1
"My account still remains active when u pull my credit report and it’s still not being updated even after my last complaint, I need this to be dealt  with ASAP, before I loose my mind because it’s been how many years since this account was close 2019 and now we in 2021",1

"Bad Attitude received at African bank Quagga today 02/08/2021. The lady was so rude to me , I was a last client and she told me she can't give me a pin on my card as she is in a rush to go fetch her child from the day care. She was telling on how it is not her problem that the other branch in Attlyn was unable to assist me on for issuing of a new card as their machine was broken . She told me to go back to Attlyn tomorrow and get a pin there because they did not call her and tell her that I am coming. So now I have cards with no PIN numbers, she refused to give me and told that she is doing me a favour for even giving me the cards because I came in at late just before they closed.  She doesn't even have a name tag on, so I could not get her name. She was the only one working when I got there. That lady is so rude. Now I being sent from pillar to post because she is in a rush to go fetch her child. ",5
"African Bank teaching their consultants to lie to customers because of their Omni system is not  efficient  I made notice last Monday on my 7days  investment today is Monday money not yet paid provided that I'm using myworld acc, I phoned their contact centre and consultant promised that I will receive funds today but still nothing funny part again in when u buy electricity on their app or ussd their system doesn't have option to send u token and their investment rates are dropping almost every month.They treat costumers unequal and hires unprofessional consultant. I will never consider African Bank for my family friends and fellow costumers who need transparent ethical treatment and user-friendly systems.if u can't make business close ur doors than making empty promises.this is not the first time I'm going through this. Everytime you're system are off line like home affairs only one branch mall of Africa is on line. You busy ruining brand image and that will lead to potential client loss. You can't make profit with cheap systems unless you underpay you're employees to maximize profit",1
"a transaction went off my account that I did not authorize from FLYSAFAIR for a flight that I DID NOT TAKE and till to date I haven't had any assistance regarding the funds that were taken unlawfully, now my debit orders bounced because of this! so disappointed in African bank .. Please fix this",1
"my acc was put on hold on 27/7/2021 for tranferring money from my credit card to my world account.
I have since called African bank on ********** everyday since wednesday till today,making a minimum of 5 calls each day and the response is just the same:”someone will call i back) and to date no one has called n the account is on hold. On thursday i was asked to go to the branch and still no help as they dont have the authority to lift the hold
Dealinh with African bank in this regard is a ningt mare",1
"My wife had a fixed interest investment in African Bank (R 116k) which matured on 17th July. When she opened the account she included in the form that the funds on maturity were to go to her Investec Prime Saver Account.  A few days before African bank tried to phone her but was a missed call. She responded by message that she did NOT wish to re-invest as their rates were no longer competitive.    which was a clear instruction to transfer the funds  to her Investec Account.  The completely ignored my instructions and put the funds into a My World Account, which was totally contrary to my instructions.   They sent an email which apologised and stated that interest will continue until they transfer the funds.  Funds were eventually transferred on 29th July 12 days late, BUT they still owe the outstanding interest of R 268.00.

They  ignored the instructions completed on the deposit opening procedures to send the funds on maturity to my Investec account.

My wife had a missed call and voice mail to return call which I did. My wife knew from past experience it would be an agent asking why my wife did not want to reinvest.
She left a voice message to say she wanted the funds to go to her Investec account as instructed on opening the investment account.

The reason she does not reinvest is your current rate is not competitive.

My wife is very angry that they did not comply with her original instructions and the ensuing debacle because she is currently in UK your agent emailed to  say you cannot contact me by phone to verify transactions. Untrue , my SA phone receives sms which I can respond to. I received one from your bank on 29th July.

Anyway,  my current problem is that you have not paid the interest due to me as per email below , from the maturity of my account on 17th July till you finally transferred the funds on 29th July. Please forward to my Investec account the amount of   R 267.18  ( 12 days at 7% ) in respect of the interest accrued by your error

A similar problem occurred with my husband's account maturing 24th July and you paid him the 7% due for the 2 delayed days.

After I applied again with all the documents once again they are asking me to resubmit information I have already submitted which is very clear because it was not scanned these were emailed pdf files from my bank and Hr so there was nothing not clear I sent another bank statement last week, they requested another for May yesterday which was already included in last weeks bank statement and when I call again this morning using my own airtime once more they tell me I must send another bank statement can you imagine.

"For the past two months I have been trying to get African Bank to help me as their customer and reduce the settlement amount, to discount me on what they quoted me as a settlement amount but I received a negative feedback (a big NO) from them.

"So I went to African Bank today at DeKema Branch Wadeville, the bad service I got wow. I went there around 12:30 I found 2 ladies, I wanted to put notice in my investment, the lady gave me a very stinking attitude she told me I cannot do that they cannot help and I said At eatstrand mall they told me in case of emergency I can do that, she did not even bother calling the head office and she was just so cold even when I greeted her I felt so unwelcome there. It’s an old lady and she was sitting close to the door , what a bad service from an old lady. I just called the head office and spoke to SThe and she is so surprised why that lady did not help because she could have just called the head office. Gave me attitude like I was asking her to borrow me her money , Sis",1

"Think twice before getting a loan from African Bank.  They are quick to lend you money at an interest rate of over 33%, but when you run into trouble with your payments and make a special arrangement with them, which they accept, they will black list you for life.  It does not matter if you make an arrangement with them, or honor this arrangement, they will still BLACKLIST you.  Even if you plead with them, to make some other arrangement to get your name of blacklisting, they simply just don't CARE.  I have phoned, I have e-mailed..... Same response........  No customer relations AT ALL.  ",1
"I played noticed on my 31 day notice account on 21st July 2021. However on the 22nd July I called to see if I could get the money before the notice period. I talked to the first consultant who said the penalty fee was going to be R4000. I told him it was too steep but he said these are the banks rules. so I asked if I could speak to his manager. The manager was not available so the assistant manager came on line but he also said the penalty amount cannot be changed. These are the banks rules. so I suggested I close all my accounts because the bank is not customer centric and that other banks are charging 0.3% to 3% and this rate is negotiable. But to no avail. when I got cross and told them about losing customer which might lead to the employees retrenchments, he then suggested I speak to the people in investments which was going to take upto 7 working days.

On the 26th July 2021 someone from investment called me but did provide a satisfactory solution to my concern. He just said the penalty which was given to me still stands. then I said since the bank is not customer centric but only interested in making money from clients and that what they are telling me is not satisfactory, they will hear from me at helloPeter.
This is what I have learned from experienced with African bank 
1. Their front line employees do not seem to be empowered to make decisions in order to retain customers
2. Their front line employees seem to be told to strictly follow rules without looking a the merit of a circumstance
3. Their front line employees seem not to understand that the customers are actually paying for their salaries and that when they lose customers, some of them will be retrenched.
4. Their front line employees seem not to understand that without customers there will be no African Bank.

I have been very disappointed by this behavior of the employees and after been a long standing client of the bank, I will be closing my accounts as soon as I get my money. I feel in the bank cant meet me at my point of need and appreciate the fact that they are actually making more money from my investment when they lend the money out than the interest they are paying me. So I will be taking my money to another bank understands me better and who are willing to negotiate with me as a valued client.

No feedback or anything from  their side. I've sent every document requested. This is EXTREMELY poor service in total 22 days AND still counting to find out if I qualify for  the loan or not.

"I am writing this with tears falling down the treatment that African Bank is giving my sick mother is heartbreaking .My mom had a credit card with them when she was still working .Unfortunately she got diagnosed with arthritis in 2019 .She was going in and out of hospitals trying to get better .Her Doctor then decided that she is medically unfit to go to work .All the paper work was done to get her under temp disability at work .we then sent documents to African bank for her insurance to pay for her credit card since she is no longer working .we got a shock of our life when we got told that she took long to calm therefore the insurance can not pay out .WHAT ????????????????????????? She is sick for God sake and her priority at that time was for her to get well and go back to work .She has been receiving call from them ever since ,they even have the guts to tell her that her acc is in arrears and they are handing it over to Lord knows where .She then agreed to give them 100 from that small money she gets from work the very same money that has to pay for her medication and Doctors visits ..The last straw was when they debited 500 from her account last month ...COME ON NEDBANK my mother is no longer working why are you doing this to her ??? Is it because she is black ??? Is it because she is woman and she can not stand up for herself??? Why was she paying for her insurance in the first place ???My mother was sick for Gods sake how was she suppose to think abt insurances at that time ??

I need you to sort this out .I also need to know who authorized the 500 debit check because I know she did not . ",1
"I was offered an adjusted oayment relief on my monthly payment on a loan as a result of covid impacting my finances amongst other things. At the time my loan was up to day with payments. A consultant called me and offered the adjustment to which I inquired (calls are recorded as was emphasised by the consultant) if the adjustment would mean my account would go into arreas. The consultant informed me that it would not go into arreas and would not reflect negatively on my credit and rating. However, I then recieved a call at the end of June to inform me my account was in arreas with the amount that had been adjusted - I was paying 50% of my installment. My query is, once I informed the bank of how I had ended up paying the amount they said it was explained to me because I should have been aware that they dont alter the installment. I am highly confused as to how their briefing within their organisation to approach customers with adverse illinformed advise went. I am 100% certain that I emphasised I would not take up the agreement if it would accumulate as arrears. I have tried to call the branch without success.I have chatted with a consultant who said I must make the payments immediately. There is no responsibility being taken by African Bank as to their consultant who misinformed me as their client. ",2

African bank is the worst institution to deal with. I calling them since Monday the 12th for simple letter stating I’m not in arrears with them ???. The call centre keeps dropping my calls,1
"AFRICAN BANK has the knack to ruin simple things, and then the aftermath is an endless process of frustration. In June 2021 I needed to reinvest a 12 month fixed deposit at AB, but the interest was poor - I could get better elsewhere (why didn't I change when I knew it would be the better choice?). I negotiated a better interest and agreed to stay with AB. Firstly, the new statement showed the lower interest, and this took a week or so to correct.
Then some mampara at head office decided to change interest payment to monthly - it had always been on expiry, and no change had been requested. So they paid out the accumulated interest and the first month's interest, which I didn't want. I complained again, and someone phoned me, and told me that I must pay back the interest; they will add it to the capital amount and backdate it to the start of the investment, and pay interest on expiry.
I paid the interest immediately into the AB account number given me. It showed a debit on my bank statement, but for some reason didn't go through to AB, and was credited again to me. Now to get this money back to AB so that I will have the benefit of a larger investment is going to be like pulling hen's teeth.
What was to be plain sailing, has become AB's tempestuous waves of frustration. So I'll forbear. But other investments at AB, on expiry, must go elsewhere. Right?",1

"I have an african bank account, for every 10 swipes you get R150 worth of vouchers. I normally receive the sms to claim early days of the month. This time around I did not receive for swipes made in June. Today the 12th July I called African Bank to enquire, the first consultant checked my statement and said I qualify as I swiped more than 10x and he will escalate it. I received a call after he escalated and the lady said from her side it doesn't show that I qualify and I must call customer service. After many back and forth on calls trying to get help I was then transferred to another consultant, who said I did not qualify because i made swipes yes but they were under R50, I told him I never received any communication saying we now need to swipe R50 to qualify. He then said I must check my SMS they sent on the 10th and the 12th June. I confirmed with him that I did not receive such SMS. I was not going to call and query if I was aware there are changes, and when I ask why these sudden changes he also does not know.

"What a disappointing experience I have had with African Bank. After I thought they were so noble by contacting me to let me know that they have funds that need to be credited to me, the experience there after went down hill. Because I couldnt give them my FNB account due to the state that it was in, an African Bank consultant told me to open an African Bank Myworld account so the funds can be deposited there. 1 and a half months later, I was still waiting and after trying to contact them for the 100th time, I finally get through, only to be told that they did try to make the refund payment, but because this Myworld account that I was advised to open is not 3 months old and has no statements, the funds kept bouncing back to them. Not one person tried to contact me regarding this issue. This means that the consultants provide customers incorrect information. over and above the fact that this Myworld account is now sitting at -R6. I thought I would keep this account, but after the terrible experience I have had, I will definitely be closing it and will not, in any near future, be considering any banking options with African Bank.",1

"I phoned African Bank on 22 June to reverse a transaction (online shopping), as the goods were never delivered, or I wasn't informed of a collection point, and the vendor didn't acknowledge any of my emails or sms messages. 
I followed up on 29 June 2021.  The agent was incompetent, couldn't pick up the reference number, and then told me it's on another system she doesn't have access to, but she can see the reference number.
I still haven't received any resolution on this query to reverse the transaction.  It's not about the amount, it's about the principal of not receiving the merchandise.",1
Your customer service is ****. Been trying to get a hold of your consultants since 10:00 this morning. One dropped the call on me after taking my details.

A request for a simple title change has gone unresolved for weeks, if not months. I was assisted by the local Vredendal branch, was made promises by the regional manager Lyle Johnson, and ""helped"" by Jeffrey Moshoka from customer complaints, to no avail, or resolve. I will now repost this review for a week long to see if there is an escalated response, and if there isn't, I will just have to accept that African Bank isn't the bank for; it is that simple.",1

Hi my name is Brian Goodgall I borrowed money from another company that was in the 1990 and the company was liquidate and the person who helped us with the loans apparently passed on so African bank took over the company according to them and I was never told nor phoned that they took over that company. Since last year I have been trying to make a personal loan but it was declined and I thought that it could maybe my credit score but that was not the case so after a couple of months I tried again and my loan was declined again so on the 28/06/2021 I went to African bank personally I ask the consultant to check if I qualify for a loan she checked for me and it was declined again and I asked and she said that I owe African bank money I said to her that I have never opened an account with African bank and she phoned Head office and spoke to another consultant and she said that I owed them money and I asked if I owe African bank any money why is that nobody tried to trace me cause I worked for a company that is well known I gave the company that offered us loans my cell and my work number so if I knew that this company was now with African bank I think I would have paid that loan and get done with it but the lady on the other side said to me that the account was prescribed and that I will never get a loan from African bank aw long the loan is prescribed but to my understanding I never took any money from African bank cause I never ever signed anything with them so I want someone from African bank to explain it to me to how do you owe someone money that you never ever signed for my number is **********,1

"I did an application with African Bank on the 24th of June.  The next day I sent an email to *********** with all the documentation that they requested.  They responded and requested more information, which I sent through minutes later.
On the 1st of July I called enquiring why they have not yet called me to let me know the outcome of my application.  The caller then made a note on my profile for one of the team leaders to call me and she said they would call me the same day or the next.  The next day, 2nd of July, I called in again and the consultant said that they can see I called yesterday and a note has been made to call me.
On the 5th I called again, at this point I still have not heard anything from the bank.  They then make another note on my profile saying the exact same thing they did on the 1st.
Yesterday, the 6th, I had to call again because no one is getting back to me and I can't continue with anything else until I have received feedback on the application.

With the initial application, they said it would take 24 to 48 hours for someone to call me back.  It has now been 10 working days (including Saturdays) and I still have not heard anything.  I have not even received a call from anyone.",1

"I was handed over from African Bank for an old loan in 2007.  Hence is is now 2021.  In 2010, I paid monthly installments via a garnishee order that I agreed to as I knew it will at least be paid before I get my salary and due to all my debt I had at the time.  In 2014, I increased my monthly installments by direct debit order as I had made this arrangement with Jansen & Jansen Attorneys (whom African Bank handed me over to).  So they stopped the garnishee order.  I paid this account finished.  African bank advised me that they did not receive any funds from any company I was handed over to.  Then they told me to send my proof to their query department called Titanic Queries. I have all my proof which I had shared with Titanic Queries to ***********.  I was told to do this after I had called African Bank on numerous occasions to try and resolve the issue.  Still African Bank wouldn't remove me from ITC and still to this day I am listed for this loan on ITC.  How is it that you hand me over and I pay it finished, yet Jansen & Jansen Attorneys didn't list me on ITC, it was African Bank.  I have spoken and sent communication to Titanic Queries email with *********** in copy.  I have spoken to and copied *********** as well, but still.   I have gone via the Ombudsman, who advised me that I should make direct contact with African Bank to remove me, as they have queried it on my behalf, but still apparently I owe this money.  Every time, I try and resolve it by calling or making contact since 2020, I have to explain the same story over and over to different people.  They have stopped calling me to collect this money, but African Bank have not bothered to remove me from ITC. ",1
"Good day,

My mother applied for a loan on the 29 June. She explained to the consultant that she is retired and gets a monthly income from Old Mutual from her retirement fund.
The consultant did the application and my mother was pre-approved for the amount that she needed. My mother submitted 3 months bank statement together with proof of income.
Now she gets an sms everyday to submit a payslip. I mean she explained her whole story that she is retired and does not have a payslip. She called the call centre yesterday explaining her story once again but now this morning she receive another sms to submit a payslip. Seriously this is frustrated.

I applied for a loan on 30 June and after a long wait was given a final offer and a value added service as they call it. The value add service is deceiving because it's not an addition because it is deducted from the initial offer that we get. And it is nowhere indicated on the page where they offer you this value add scam. I had loaned this money for other purposes and I cant meet those purposes because I was scammed by African Bank. The little money that  was left from the initial loan was finally paid on the 6th of July that's when I discovered I was robbed. I need the money desparately i logged a complaint i need to wait 48 hours for their errors and then i will wait another 48 hours for the money to be paid in my account. I've already waited so long and I'm continuing to wait. It's your error African Bank and its your deceitful statements that has cause me a this. Please fix this mess. Your call centre does not even see how deeply I'm affected by this. The rules and statements are man made fix them. I need that money asap. In 72 hours the medical purposes will probably be dead. Covid kills people in less than 72 hours.,1

"I am really disgusted that you have lied to me and said you have fix my May credit profile with ITC, whereas you know very well that your incompetent is above you and failing in every way.

I have launch a dispute with ITC again, further to this I will cancel your debit order and you will not debit my account again so you have a reason to list me in arrears. I regret taking a loan with you as you have failed me and I won't let you get away with it.

Your incompetence has cost me, and I will take this to court, and media so that you do not do it to other people again. I will repeat that you are reason why we get decline by other credit providers, charged higher interest rates just because your systems are non-existent. I was never in arrears for May, your best poor system put me in arrears and you need to fix it with immediate effect.

"I opened an investment account January 2020. After few deposits, 2 of those they said they didn't receive but the account was linked.  Went to the branch few times and called few times but a year later they are still investigating not even providing feedback.

"Hi There,
If you are considering investing with African Bank think twice, maybe the history might repeat itself now when the ReserveBank is pulling its over sight. If you have investments with the African Bank, monitor it closely. We have been getting the messages that they will be freezing our investments and we seem to get nowhere with our communication with them.

be warned",1
" WHOM IT MAY CONCERN
I
During February 2021, I requested a settlement amount on my outstanding balance at African Bank. 
Regrettably, the money earmarked to settle the balance in full, was hacked from my cellphone app.
R 100 000 was trasferred to four different African Bank accounts. Due to this incident, I was not able to settle my account, as intended. As I am on pension, it is not financially possible to honor the monthly payments. HOWEVER, the  I have been corresponding with African Bank in this regard on numerous occasions. An offer to settle the outstanding debt has been forwarded to the debt Department. NO feedback has been received and constant follow-up efforts are ignored. 
I am extremely frustrated and annoyed with African Bank. Constant efforts to settle the outstanding balance on the debt owed, has, to date, not been acknowledged. Despite all the above efforts, I have been receiving numerous calls with threats of legal action. The only conclusion I come to, is that African Bank has no professional conduct, are lacking professionality in their client relations and urgently need to step-up their internal communications and ignorance regarding correspondece.

"Dear African Bank Team,

Since the beginning of this year, I have been receiving SMSes from African Bank which are addressed to Mr V Zitha.
Thereafter, I have received numerous phone calls from consultants from African Bank looking for Mr Zitha as well.
I have explained to all the consultants that I am not Mr Zitha, and have requested for my phone number to be removed from the system.

However, till today, I am still receiving these messages and phone calls.
As your consultants have been made aware that they have the incorrect number, this now constitutes harassment.

Once again, I request that my phone number be removed from your system and in future, the company should ensure due diligence in verifying the contact numbers of their clients and mitigate such discrepancies which lead to these incidents.",1

"Hai , I have data and my they might respond, African bank are fraud and if I can escalate this they might go out of business, they faked payments in the prescribed loan account and claimed I made payments, asked the person called me regarding this poor agent couldn't even tell me which bank this was paid from. They not going to respond but one thing they should know is that they would be proving this Infront of FSCA for fraud and compliance to the regulation and their Key Individual might be in jail for 10 years or millions would be paid to as fine. Just needed to log a formal complaint before I can proceed with FSCA REGULATOR if this cannot be proven. Prescribed debts are been frauded at African bank they create fake payments",1

Whilst you guys have taken the funds we didn't agree on.

"I previously had an account with African Bank that was handed over to NBA. I paid  up the account and received a paid up letter in September 2020. All the credit bureaus removed the account from my profiles and everything is on order.  However when I tried to apply credit with African Bank in April I received a decline letter saying that my account is arrears.  

Upon contacting African Bank with my dispute reference number: ********** I was told that there is nothing that can be done about as it was handed over to 3rd party.  That certainly does not make sense, 3rd party has been paid in full provided my paid up letter and update all the bureaus accordingly and there is nothing African bank can do by their records stating I am in arrears?

I then escalated further to Lungisa *********** from ombuds and regulatory disputes and to date i have not received a call or any feedback. i have tried calling her numerous times ********** but calls go unanswered.

So African Bank,  please assist urgently on updating my account on your side, or is it that once a client goes into arrears they will never be assisted with credit by African Bank again?",1
Again they deduct double 6000 as the agreed payment was 3000 this is happening every month african bank is not organised bad verry bad im fed up with african bank,1
"African bank was the only bank or financial institution that was able to help me at a time of need.

And as we know employment in South Africa is not easy to get so I've been asking for credit from banks so I can build my credit score so we can get a car and he can get into Uber/bolt and have an income to assist in the house. I really appreciate how African Bank was willing to go that extra mile and give me credit with my score. You are amazing and I'm looking forward to great things with the bank",5

I am so utterly exasperated by your continuous unethical and unlawful behaviour pertaining to my loan payments, I have endured this inconvenience and unethical behaviour for far too long now, my contractual agreement states that you people are to debit my account on the 25th of every month as that is aligned with my payment dates, however you debit my account any time it suits you!

Getting in contact with anyone is a tedious process you are more likely to hold for 30min without anyone assisting you, this is frustrating to say the least!

"The rewards system used to be great, I used to redeem my R150 checkers voucher monthly and used it every month.

Now I am battling again and wonder if this is a way of forcing me to rather option for African Bank to pay my bank fees and the rest of the vouchers has become just a show?

Next, I request a callback and a rude agent give me a call at 7:00 in the morning and ask me many questions about my expenses and tell me based on my expenses I only qualify for R5000 and R13000 which is very laughable because it even below my disposable income. I asked whether it is based on the credit score and he affirms that it is based on the expenses assessment. SO WEIRD.

I then sent all required documents with a notice from the agent stating that I will be contacted for a final offer. After few hours I received a decline SMS stating the application was unsuccessful because they could not verify the bank account.

I then called my bank which state no requests were made and I should have received a notification if a pull was made.

I called back African bank which could not state the reason and ask me to reapply through the agent online which I did and then, after 2 days they asked me to resend my bank statements that I already sent through the second application again and at 10 PM I receive the same decline reason.

WHAT A BIG WASTE OF TIME. If you are unable to give a client a loan, please stop misleading people and pull my credit info for your own benefit. I request that my profile get deleted from your system. It is a thing that I never approached this bank and it is a confirmation that I will NEVER EVER even refer anyone from ever trying to do any business with the bank. ",1
"Best customer service ever, from this specific lady",5
My experience with African Bank was horrible and horrific. During this pandemic African Bank didn't even make effort in assisting me after I did sent all the needed documents after being retrenched due to Covid 19. I would not recommend or refer anyone to African Bank ever again.,1
I am so disappointed at African Bank as I'm not able to link my account with PayPal!!!,1
"I applied for a credit card with african bank on wednesday the 9th, they instructed me to send all of my documents, friday they called me to do a contract as they stated that I have been approved. Monday I collected my card from the branch. I tried logging in on the app on m phone and it said application pending but they did a contract with me. They set a debit order from my absa acc for more than R 600. When I called them on tuesday explaining the card is not active neither does the app work they said the application is pending? after  they set up a debit on my acc and gave me a card? what the actual f? I asked the sales lady why they never informed me of this and why do they work backwards and she dropped my call? African bank you are useless and I would like to cancel the whole process with you as I will not start something like this!!!!",1
"Good Morning,

I am a bit irritated.
I called you contact centre and requested a call back. I get called back I speak to Margaret. Okay, I didn't have a problem I give her my ID number unfortunately I don't get the authorization option on my cell. I let her know she then says we can't proceed with the call but she quickly came back to her senses. And asked me security questions. I answered them. She then coughs in the phone and no sorry  or anything she proceeds as if nothing happened . In between I am being told ""sorry I can't hear you"". Until I pointed it out to her that she is working from home the lines are not really clear at times, I will call back. instead of me being asked to shout my details and reasons for calls.

I have dealt with African Consultants in the past and they have been very professional and I thought it is the company culture until today's call.

My main reason for calling is that I don't have access to the banking app. I  wanted to enquire if it will be possible to skip a payment on my oan for this month. And if it can be authorized on their side since I can't access the internet banking and the app. Instead of her being hostile.

"Hi I would just like to commend Pat that works for African Bank Fishoek on the Great service he provided, the fact that he listened to my concerns and the fact that he was very attentive, I got more than what I asked for when I left the branch and was a very happy client... I would definitely recommend African bank to my friends and family.... The team at African Bank Fishoek are great assets to the company, and if I could I would definitely recommend a raise?.... Well done team Fishoek",5
"African Bank is a useless Bank.
I made a TFSA (Tax-Free Savings Account) last year 2020, it Matured on the 19th of May 2021! They didn't call me to allow me to excercise my Options around weather or not to extend my Investment.

I started to make a follow up last week Tuesday on the 7th of June, requesting my money as if I am making a Loan! They said I should wait for 2 working days; I gave them over 3 working days and went back, only to be told that my Claim hasn't gone through and should wait for another 24 hours!

This guy's played me with my money and frustrated me over what is mine. I wouldn't recommend anyone to use African Bank TFSA, Unless you call stress to yourself in time of making Claims. 

Even worse, they even told me that I will be penalised if I withdraw the Money now. Despite maturing time has passed. If it's a miss communication from their Branch to the Head Office, then that qualifies them as a bank that doesn't care and doesn't take customer's serious.",1
During this tough time my wife applied for a loan she is a good client at african bank 2 weeks ago we call daily but still nothing we have kids to feed and things to pay why would a bank take 2 weeks and not even bother to contact you in regards to your loan application 24hour policy I don't think so,1
I applied for a loan on the 07th of June - all documents submitted and a week later I have had no response. The lady I dealt with asked me to cc her team leader in - Lillian Sekolayane. I have sent numerous emails to her and the service team and no one bothers responding. What a joke that funds reflect in your account within 72hours. Change your website as you are falsely advertising.,1
"1. On Friday 11 June 2021 I went into the African Bank Branch at Eastgate and requested that my contact details be updated for the 100th time! SMS's from African Bank go to my son's number. The very friendly assistant changed my cell number to my contact number. This morning my son once again received an SMS from African Bank, 3 days after I had changed it for the 100th time.  African Bank you are contravening the POPI act by allowing my son access to my personal banking details. 
2. On Friday 11 June 2021 I was once again embarrassed by the very smart African Bank rewards when my vouchers were 'INVALID' at Checkers, Eastgate. I was the fool with the full trolley and 2 invalid vouchers! Again! I had to leave my trolley and go to the branch at the opposite end of the mall, on the lower level. Of course, they could not get through to the relevant service provider and of course, they made me wait forever with the callback, and of course, it has once again not been resolved.",1

Good day,

Regarding the below sms I received,

I think I accidentally type in my password wrong, I then phoned your call center and they tried to reset it, but the problem was that I didn't get a pop up message on the screen of my phone and the number**********) I'm using, is the number that are registered with you(African Bank), I used a lot of airtime trying to get through to your call center and, 

I'm unable to go to your branch, because I'm working every day, 

Please assist urgently, 

Hello, you have blocked your African Bank profile. Call **********or go to your nearest branch for assistance. Alternatively, reply with HELP for a call back

I had a tracer come to my work place to sign forms.one account was not there. So the amount for the two accounts were agreed upon.but the 3rd account was not cause I didn't have it with the tracer.now they have debited full amount for the 3rd account. When I called them they said the 3rd account is handed over to lawyer so I asked why has African bank debited my account n I have not heard from their lawyers. But they can't answer me. I need the money reversed back as it was sent to my account for school fees now I'm stuck.i called their call centre and up to now have not heard from them,1

Thank you for your bad service ",1
"I have taken the loan with you and you debit my account on a monthly basis. After receiving a loan, I had fake calls of people claiming that they were from african bank and asking about how was the service. 

Now you have updated me on ITC profile as someone in arrears because  of R14.10, you are the one taking money from account via debit order, now where is this R14.10 coming from. You are messing my credit score because of your unprofessionalism and this really irritate me. I cannot deal with incompetent people who can't even secure my data and update my account accordingly.

I want you to update my account accordingly at ITC, I am not in arrears and if this is not the case I will take this far. ",1
"If there was a zero I would love to rate African Bank that, again after almost two months still no answer on my loan application after submitting it again on Saturday 5th June 2021 received an sms yesterday that all documents have been received and they finalizing my application, I had to phone them again this morning just to be told I have to resubmit my documents now my question is why send out an sms saying documents received and they finalizing it but when you call its a different story, this must be the worst bank and customer service of any bank the employees of the bank is incompetent, no wonder they have 1,6 rating, if you read the other reviewes it seems a lot of people have the same problem, I think they need to fire the CEO of the bank clearly she has no clue on how to run a bank or business and than in general just close African Banks doors for good, its rediculous on how long a person should wait for a response and they tell you they'll phone you back yah right Christmas is tomorrow aswell. I have never experienced something as bad as this clearly another sign that th re are people in positions that are not suppose to be there. i probably receive another call telling me that they'll sort it out and than another week or two will pass with no response they can keep their **** I'm not interested anymore and as a African Bank client I'll close my account and move to another bank.",1

"African Bank PERSONAL LOANS which i have been listed for on my credit report. (Listed since October 2017) the account balance i owe is R15028. Please note that i have not had any communication regarding the African Bank personal loan account and thus note that any African Bank loan acc that  African Bank is calling about is dormant and has NOT been acknowledged in the past 3 or more years. Therefore, this account is prescribed and what you are doing is illegal. 
I have not acknowledged the debt in the past 3 consecutive years either by writing or verbally, not made any payment towards the outstanding amount, nor have i promised to pay. No summons has been issued in the last 3 years. They are in contravention of the NCA SEC 126b. It states that no person may continue collection or re-activation of such prescribed debt as prescription Act 68 of 1969(Prescription Act). 
Debt therefore prescribed and im not legally bound to repay such. I request this matter be closed and any negative information will be removed from my credit record. Should i receive any emails i will lay a complaint with the relative authorities, ie, NCR and LSSA.
Please attend to this matter soonest and mail a prescribed letter that this account is closed ",1
"I received the worst service ever when it comes to resolving African Bank's electronic banking from their website.  I have now been battling more than three days to get it resolved and when I called the call centre the agent told me that it is within the 72 hour turnaround time.  But also added that no one has looked at the matter as yet.  It is pathetic, because now I have to schlep up and down to the bank.",1

"My journey with African Bank was not an easy one. I felt like you are dismissing me in applying for credit card without giving me the opportunity. You treated me like hooligan. I am honest, loyal, a woman on integrity. You can get referrals from my banks Capitec and Standard bank. I have a very clear and clean credit profile. I was not even surprised when you declined my application. Samuel gave me a call on Monday to let me know that my application has been declined due to uncer*****y with my current company. In answer to that he mentioned that there is retrenchment happening in my company which it didn't affect me and honestly speaking i was not even aware of that because i am not affected. When i asked my HR department they cannot recall  African Bank phoned to confirm my appointment. I need to know the name of the person who confirmed my appointment because i doubt you even called my company.",1

"I applied for an online loan and was approved, suddenly i need to go to my nearest branch for biometrics verification.

I contacted African bank on the number in the sms and consultant said i should tell them is wicode and need to be processed under the wicode and well i went again to shoprite and same results invalid and next day i called them again and was told they would check and revert to me and which they never did and then i called again and to my surprise i was told the voucher has expired and was suppose to have called earlier and the consultant was even rude to me and now been trying to call them again and now no answer.

"On the 24/05/2021 I applied for a loan at one of African Bank branches . They took all the paperwork said and gave me the amount I qualified for, and put the debit order in the system saying head office will call me. 25/05/2021 I received an sms saying my papers are not clear they need bank statement. I went to their branch and gave the 3 months bank statement. On 26/05/2021 another sms saying my papers are not clear they need latest payslip. I printed it and took it to the branch. 27/05/2021 another sms saying they need Employment Confirmation, I called my HR and they emailed me the letter which I then sent to the branch. 28/05/2021 another sms saying they need a Variance Letter. Then I called your head office and while I was on the call explaining my dilemma a call came through from African Bank. It was a lady from the Review department she said she needed the variance letter because my salary was not the same. I didn't understand because my gross is the same and I explained to her that my nett fluctuate because I do overtime and it's stated on the payslip. She insisted she needed a variance letter with a compost stamp. Well I now had to email my payroll to get the variance letter which I then forwarded to the lady she said it was the last thing they need from me. I heard nothing from them after that, the lady from the branch contacted me and said they will do the payment that day. On Monday afternoon I received another sms saying they need papers for Credit Life which I had no idea what that was!!! So on 02/06/2021I went to the branch in town which I was using previously and I complained and explained my dilemma they sent an email to Head Office telling them about the Credit Life paperwork. Then in the evening I receive another sms still requesting Credit Life papers. I am really disappointed with African Bank I have a long-standing relationship with them and I feel they are treating me like a criminal on top of that sending me from pillar to post for nothing! ",1

I requested a settlement that came around R155k to settle the loan early, I requested a discount on the settlement because I only have around R80k to R90k that i can settle with, but i was told it can happen because the system has not yet send me an SMS to confirm that I qualify for a discount. My problem with this is that I'm currently going through a difficult time financially and want to try and manage my affairs and settle the biggest loan on my profile but African Bank don't want to help me to settle, maybe I need to try debt review and only pay them R600pm ",1

The service I am currently receiving from African back is minimal to none. I have opened a query with regards to two different settlement amounts I have received on my personal loan. My query message said it would take 48hours.that time has passed. I have called African Bank over 6 times on day to get feedback. The agents either cannot access my ID or drop the phone on me.

Boom 25 May they debited, I called the 26 May , they picked it up from their system and promised to refund within 72hours but no refund. 1st June follow up after receiving nothing but still no help, today 2nd June I'm told I still owe a R1000....Duduzile couldn't answer my questions regarding this , as usual the matter was escalated to the supervisor.

"is this the only way of getting assistance from African Bank, everytime i call the call centre, they are just in a hurry to end the call without even assisting ,Siphiwe Maseko is a typical example of this, please listen to your calls, I told him that I wanted to extend my date to settle my account with just a week and a half and he did not even give me a chance to explain, he quickly placed me on hold then told me that my date of settling has expired, although I tried to explain that from last week, you call and hold for about 15min to speak to someone, or even when u request for a call back, the automated system will call you, then keep you holding for about 10min, he did not even care about that, he just told me that I need to speak to "" Legal "", I told him straight away that, I have been throught this and I will definitely get disconnected, he just answered "" Yes"" and just gave me a number and just transferred my call and guess what I got disconnected, and as I was instructed by this unprofessional person, I called the ********** number, it said i must press the extension and obviously i do not know anyone that works there, i selected the option to speak to an operator, 3 times i tried that and i just got disconnected as soon as I press 0, when people are begging for jobs, they are as humble as can be and promise to work hard and put the client first, as soon as they get the job, they turn into a "" Siphwe Maseko"" where the client does not matter and the company gets such reviews, we are clients that needs assistance and we should be told straight up if we not entitled to get assistance when we call customer care, we also want to write good reviews about companies but with the service offered by African bank's employees, how on earth is that possible ",1
"Being harrassed daily in regards to a temporary worker, when asked to remove the business number from their system and contact the worker on his cellphone number the African Bank employee gets irritated and says she will call back the next day again, after I have told her I do not even see the worker or have any contact and also that the worker is not permanent.",1

"I do not want to rate African Bank, but I have to as without the rating I can't go further.
I have had such bad service continued from their customer care department.
Late yesterday afternoon I phoned them and requested a call back.
i was still on the line and I was receiving a call back from them.
How can you take a call, when you are still on the line?
surely they can see you are on their system.
i waited for about 3 and a half minutes and there was no answer from anyone to assist me, so I put the phone down.
i then phoned again, managed to get off the line  after once again asking for a call back. I then received a call back and waited this time for almost 11 minutes before a customer care representative came on the line to help me.
Which actually was of no assistance at all. i could hardly understand what the representative was saying and she spoke sooooooooooooo slowly that it was awful.
 i have continued to complain about this issue and have now decided to take it to the ombudsman, as African Bank have lied to their clients. I have a ""my world"" bank account and if you swipe ten times in a month you get a R150 voucher, there are various vouchers you can choose. Last month I decided to change my choice and instead of getting the cashback which I was supposed to get they told me, this would pay my bank charges. I DID NOT ASK YOU TO PAY MY BANK CHARGES AFRICAN BANK. I ASKED FOR THE CASH BACK!!!!!!!! Surely it should be the clients decision how they use their cash back???? i would like an answer and I would like it to be displayed for every one for future reference. You have said in previous posts that I can only see your answer, well, actually their has been NO ANSWER!!!!!!! You have until the end of today, to give me last months cash back voucher, which is actually from the previous month, April, as we haven't received May's sms of as yet!!!!",1
i am deeply disappointed in the lack of communication by African bank. i applied for a load on the 26/05/2021 at the branch at Sam Ntuli mall but still have not received any feedback. I am not evens sure if the application was approved and declined. i have been sending emails and requesting for call backs on the system that they have in place but nothing. i am lost for words by the customer service. ,1
I called african bank to inform them that my debt has prescribed. They came back and told me they can not cancel it as it has not prescribed. They promised to send me a letter so i can lodge a complaint with the bank ombudsmen. It has been two months and i have not recieved anything from them. Everyone seems to not be aware of what am talking about. Yet am being bombarded with calls everyday. Please send me that letter or remove that debt.,1
"Just when a person think that it was save to allow debit orders to run from African Bank, an issue creeps in.
Is it theft that after arranging amounts with African Bank and they do run it correct but then suddenly the next month that an amount bigger than what they have been authorized gets deducted from my account? As this is now a problem as that now causes other debit orders to fail.
Upset about this yes I am, but more wondering if the person responsible for this theft out of my account will be punished?",2
These people are collecting on PRESCRIBED ACCOUNT. I will approach Credit ombudsman now. It is against the law for African bank to collect on prescribed account,1
"My husband just bought electricity and no token was sent to him, just an sms showing that money went out, we had to sleep in the dark, what nonsense is this. He's been calling them the whole day no assistance.",1
"It's almost a year since I've complained about my app not working, I've made peace and started using the website instead, but now my profile has been blocked and I don't know why, went to the branch to reset my profile but the agent told me that it gives him an error message that he doesn't understand.  He logged a call to support for assistance and they said they will assist me within 7 days. Until then, I can not access my account nor my pockets until they decide to call me. I'm frustrated to say the least. Lastly,  I qualified  for R150 voucher but you send me an sms that said ""due to technical error you were unable to send me the voucher"" I don't understand, I need urgent assistance as I would like to have access to my money ",1

"I am truly concerned that in these times of scammers and fraudsters, it would seem that African Bank just go around sharing customers personal details.

I will agree, I might have missed some payments but about a month back I had a debt collection company calling me and telling me they have been referred by African Bank and that they wanted to make arrangements with me to pay but whilst we were making payment arrangements, African Bank kept trying to debit whilst the account is handed over. I queried this and was told the bank would stop debiting and then the recoveries team would then make an arrangement but they never came back to me.

Today I get a call from another company also saying they have been sent by African Bank and this guy says to me that African Bank can choose who they give client details to since I signed for that when I took out my loans, well I surely did not sign for details to be sent to everyone in the country to use and abuse my details as they please. 

As a bank you would think they would be very sensitive with client information but seems like they don't care and I surely wonder if they are complying with POPI.",1
"I applied via telephone for a loan yesterday. The loan was provisionally approved. The consultant said that he would send me details of what I need to send via sms. I never received the sms yesterday.

Today, I called to enquire about the holdup. The first bit of ridiculousness is the call-back system. After holding for some time, I selected the option for a consultant to call me back. But I immediately got a call back by an automaton and had to sit listening to the hold music for more than 10 minutes. What a stupid system. The reason a client selects a call back is usually because we don't want to sit on the phone. Call us back when you are ready to speak to us.

Secondly, the push message to verify my identity didn't work. So we had to do security questions. ""Did you give African bank permission to send you marketing material?"" What an inane question. Who remembers such things?

However, when I said I couldn't remember, the consultant tried to force me to guess. This I can't do. However, then the process can't move forward, the question, he said, can't be changed. I would have to go into a branch to complete the application. 

Really? You don't want my business?

When I told him that I was going to file my complaint on HelloPeter, he just refused to assist further. He refused to give me his name. He just slammed the phone in my ear without even the courtesy of so much as a goodbye.

No problem. I have a great loan history with Direct Axis. Never ever have I had a problem with them. You may take your loan offer and shove it. I will get a loan on Monday from them rather.

"I am under the process of insolvency and have a letter from the lawyers regarding the process and that I am unable to pay anything. African bank is the only company that didn't want to accept this and didn't want me to email them the letter from the lawyers. They keep on deducting money from my account every single month while I am on this process. This is UNACCEPTABLE and I will take this further. 

This is really pathetic service.. ",1

"To whom it may Concern

Early this month on the 10 May 2021,my husband was hijacked at gun point.

The robbers took the car
Phone and bank cards.

They realized that my husband's phone had the app for Capitec they asked for the pin n then increased their daily limit.

My money that they took it was R16k plus, I called Capitec to stop the card and cancel them. After that they gave me a
 referee number 8********** and the forensics email, ***********

And nothing has been done from their side MTD
So I took the initiative to go to the bank (Capitec three Rivers) on the 15 May 2021 and enquire and the lady who assisted me was also lost, or didn't know where to refer me for an updates. So I ended up asking for bank statements so dat I can see what had happened 

I am dissatisfied with the service and their lack of enthusiasm to help me. So my R16k it's gone for nothing. ",1

Upon our surprise to realise that the prices were purposefully inflated and logged calls to query this none of them have even to respond even thou I had stated on my mail that I will be taking this matter up with the Ombudsman. The purpose of logging the call was to allow them a right of response or rather clarify which they have failed dismally to address. Furthermore, when you call the call centres they give information that does not mate sense and when you interrogate the info you are told a call will be logged even thou they have failed to respond to the logged ones. African bank is scamming people and are operating outside of the realm of legality but use their interpretation of the law to exploit people.

I called african bank and i was advised that because it was weekend they reserved those funds and would be released by Monday but sadly that didn't happen. I called again Tuesday and i was advised that money will be released midnight to mr price n that didn't happen i called on Wednesday and this consultant tells me that this issue may take upto 7 working days and she will log a query for it sonce it wasn't done. Can u understand the frustration at this point??? And she asked if I want the funds back to my account or to mr price still, n i asked for funds to be reversed back to my account coz it was pointless as the stuff I ordered were now out of stock. She told me funds would be in my account within 48hrs. It's Saturday today and still nothing!!! How can african bank be so cruel and inconsiderate?? I honestly regret using their bank to do this.

"I would like to write to express my dissatisfaction with African Bank. I made a commitment to pay my loan through a debit order to go off my account at the end of the month over the repayment period. This month May 2021, they debited my account the amount due of R736,45 on the 03 May 2021. Suddenly ,8 days later they went again to debit my account for the second time in the same month, the same amount of R736,45 - so they basically debited my account twice even though l had not missed any payment. I went to the branch to reverse the double payment where l was issued this reference number ********** for the reversal which was supposed to have happened within 72 hours according to their sms and guess what dololo. 
Nobody from African Bank bothered to phone me to provide feedback. I logged a call on Wednesday 12 May 2021 and today is 21 May 2021 – still no update but they are keeping my money which they stole from my account – that is theft.
I made an initiative to make a follow up on Wednesday 19th of May 2021 and spoke to the call centre agent who lied to me by making false promises - she advised that her supervisor will contact me within the next 30 minutes to resolve this – since then there has been no contact from African Bank.
This is bad image for African Bank, l have been their loyal customer for over 3 years now and this is how they thank me for my loyalty.
Unhappy Customer,

African bank is now offering discounts on prescribed account. Mr Mchunu's account is prescribed and you need to send Prescription letter.

"At this moment, I don't even want to give African Bank one star!!!! I am so fed up with them!!!! I have a "" My world"" account with them and if you swipe ten times in the month you can get a reward of R150 in many forms. one of the ways you can get it is in cash back. Every month, I normally take the Shoprite/Checkers voucher, but this month I decided I would take the cash back option as I needed the cash.WHAT A JOKE!!!!! The cash back is not cash back it is to pay your banking fees, but they don't tell you that, So I contacted them about three weeks ago and well!!!!!! I am still waiting to hear back from them. Cash back is cash back not to pay your bank charges and I wan my money they owe me.

it makes me spitting mad when companies do things like this, as this is blatant dishonesty.

"african bank takes more than 11 days to process a loan and is against digital channels in the midst of covid and in the 21st century. the whole online process is not efficient and requires serious optimisation if they are to remain relevant because a client with other options will not accept such a pathetic service. i applied for a loan online on the 30th of april, passed the pre screening phase, got a list of offers  and was requested to upload , bank statemet, payslip and id and i did exactly that the same time/day. it took two days for african bank to send a message requesting an employment confirmation letter despite the fact that the payslip uploaded  has group HR contact numbers. i igot the letter same day and uploaded it. it took another two days for them to review the application and on Day numner 5 they told me the letter just stated that i started working in 2012 and am still employed , it doesnt state that i am permanently employed so i could be a temp for the past 10years .  i went back again to my employer to request an african bank customised letter which i got the same day, uploaded onto their online portal. it took another two days to get feedback that african bank requires a salary varaince letter. i just got an sms about this variance letter, no one bothered calling me  explaining whose girlfried is 'variance letter'  so i had to look for a dioctionary and call the bank myself to understand what they meant about the variuance leter. pathetic enough the variance was due to my bonus being paid in march and on the payslip its written 'bonus'. this simply suggests that african bank employs staff who cant read a basic payslip or require training. i called the bank again today and the consultant advised that the mater has been escalated  and i will be called in an hour or two but its now about 1930hrs, 6 hours have lapsed and still no word from african bank.upto now the loan is still not finalised despite the fact that i passed the pre screening stage based on my credit record, income and affordability. i asked the telephone  consultant who advised, had i gone to the branch this loan would have been finalised! why on earth a normal bank would advocate to people crowding in a branch in the 21st century and worse off with covid? african bank must understand when a client applies for a loan, they need the cash and a turn around time of more than 10 days and still nothing finalised is but just madness!",1

The point I want to make: I qualified for this reward/s, then I was sent a unique code I can use to claim that R150 value of rewards, and then after login and claim, I did not receive an SMS with wi-code (Voucher number). After a day I still did not receive the sms, then I decided to call their 011 call center number, and the answer I got from the person was that before the end of the day which was 5th May 2021 am going to receive an sms because there was a backlog with SMSs, in short up to today(7 May 2021) I received NOTHING!

"African bank is constantly spamming me with unsolicited calls. I have never had an account with them, nor will I even remotely consider any of their services because of this.

African bank seems desperate for new business and when there is no option to opt out, or they do not adhere to it, this goes against the law. If they are willing to break one law, how many others would they break?

"Wow - I am very surprised at the horrible service I have been receiving. I need to phone in daily for an update every day I am told something different like they need June bank statements  and they need to redo the call online. The first consultant put my number incorrectly now I need to go into their branch to fix her mistake. I spoke to Mpho yesterday, who doesnt have the slightest idea of good customer service. I just need feedback on my application because for 2 and a half weeks for something that should take 24 - 48 hours is bad. Clients come back for the experience... ",1
"I made a loan application on 29 April 2021 , forwarded all documentation on numerous occasions, but no reply or response! Terrible customer service! Just Sowing in Progress on the App, called in several times, wait longer than 15 min on a call. Pathetic!",1
My outstanding balance and Credit profile not updated at TransUnion ITC. My settlement amount shows as if am not paying,1
"I have been in contact  with African bank since March explaining to them that an account has prescribed and need to be removed from my credit report. African bank came back via Basani Mathebula who is a supervisor for legal collection to tell me that the account has not prescribed and i then asked for proof to ascertain what they are saying. A month later I recieved recordings from Basani. On the recordings...there are two women communicating. The caller was looking for me and called a certain woman who confirmed that she does not know me. I have since reported the matter to the credit bureau cause this is disadvantaging me. I want to urge african bank to remove the accounts and provide me with proper evidence against my claim of prescription, failure to do that within 5 days will cause me to contact my attorneys",1
"I still haven't received a call back regarding my credit card application and they do not even answer their calls, its been 3 weeks now!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

"I have been struggling to make a payment from my credit card since last week Saturday on my cellphone banking app.
Their cellphone app is not user friendly.I called their call centre last week to assist on how to make a payment from my credit card, they sad it’s  not possible.I went to their Eastgate Mall branch yesterday,I was advised to open a savings account then I would be able to make the payment.off which I did open a savings account.

I am still unable to make the payment.I then contact their call centre again this morning,the agent say she is sending me pop up messages which I do not receive,then she says she is not sure if I have changed my number,she then suggests I should hang up and call back and punch in my Id number so she can assisit,.The frustrating part about this is that their answering machine verified my cellphone number and asked for my Id number before I even spoke to the call centre agent.

African bank staff lack professionalism and knowledge about their own brand and products.How difficult can it be to make a payment from your cellphone banking app and no one is able to assist yet people get paid as consultants and call centre agents.

I advise that African bank consults with other banks on a better banking app and training for their staff.

This entire process and experience with African Bank has been appalling to say the very least.",1
"It's been more then a week no feedback 
I've been calling everyday now.

As i wait for my money over 20 days later and every time I call I am told to wait another 72 hours or 5 working days. Yesterday the person I spoke to said I should know it takes 40 days for forensics to work on an investigation. As I wait for my R160 i will not give up.

This bank has listed my wife with an adverse for an account she paid and settled. It has now been 2 months since they were fixing the problem and now we cannot buy our business assets because of them. They are bullies who do not care about us.,1
AfricanBank placed a mandate on my bank account and refused to refund the INCORRECT amount they debited. Spoke to Pauline who was condescending then hung up on me.,1
"So i applied for a credit card, approved last week and sent them the supporting documents as well last week but till today i am still awaiting for feedback, tried calling **********to follow up with them with no success, this is really not a good client experience service at all and trust you me i might as well apply with other banks.

"i applied for a loan for 150 000 , the agent said its not the final amount , after 2 weeks of calling  african bank to find out if if the loan had been approved they kept wasting my time telling me they are short staffed , after trying to call them the entire day today they then told me that i only qualify for 5000 , this company is a complete waste of time, energy and effort , i will never deal with them again! ",1
"I am very disappointed, dissatisfied and very unhappy with what african bank did to me. They put my account on hold without communication. I went to the bank and I was not assisted I was told my bank account is active. Meanwhile the bank account doesn't even allow me to check my balances on the ATM.",1
"I am absolutely disappointed by this bank. Almost a week now they have been playing cat and mouse. For every time I call I am either told different stories nd that my matter is either being escalated or is already escalated and that a manager will call e back. Not once in a million times I've called them has a manager called me back and for every time I call and ask for one, I'm told they are in a meeting. I am disgusted by how unproffessional and untrustworthy this bank is",1
"I am upset and disappointed with African bank, 7 years ago I was a victim of fraud the imposter took out a loan and a credit card using my details.  I discovered this and alerted African bank then they investigated the matter and it was proven that indeed I was a victim of fraud and the accounts were closed but now this month I have discovered that this information is still appearing on my credit report,  when I discovered this,I called African bank on the 13th and spoke to Emanuel who assured me that the matter has been escalated to the relevant department that will do the update but didn't.  On the 20th of I called Mashudu and he confirmed that the matter did not reach the relevant department and promised me that the relevant department will call me within certain hours and that did not happen, on the 20th I called again and spoke to Miranda who said they will give me feedback within in 7 days and I said she should put her supervisor on the phone because I was starting to get fed-up with the empty promises and lies.I spoke to him and he promised to give feedback before the end of business day on the 21st but he didn't call as he had promised,  his name is Ndodenhle Dlamini. I am missing out on a great business opportunity because of a false  negative credit report, because someone failed to update and it is definitely not my fault that African bank failed to do a proper credit check before giving out the loan.",1
"My account has been put on hold without any communication whatsoever. I need to do transfers and withdrawals ASAP but they are not assisting me with anything.

DO NOT BANK WITH AFRICAN BANK, WORST BANK EVER ",1
"Extremely happy with their service, they were the only bank willing to give me a loan when I really really needed it, it was a quick process and I had the money, They helped me with a break on my loan when I needed it without any hassles, and when I requested a settlement quotation they were fast to assist and very friendly, I feel like I cannot say enough good things, will definitely recommend them and make use of their services in the future.",5
"My mother is an elderly, bedridden lady, who cannot leave the house.

She has some debit orders that we need to cancel on her Capitec account.

Despite me, having power of attorney on her account, and me calling the customer service number and visiting their branch near me, I was told that this cannot be done, unless she visits a branch herself. I was considering to move my accounts to them, because of lower fees, but this has changed my mind.

"Customer service is the pits!!! 2 weeks and no proper feedback on my request.
Every time I call in, no manager is available to speak to me - they are always in a meeting.

Consultants are liars and their systems are forever offline. I'm taking my business somewhere else",1
Whats the point of using my World Account when they cannot provide you a statement thats is older than 12 months period while other banks can offer... Whats the role of your  IT Technicians.... I call the bank to request a statement from 1 Feb 2020 to 31 March 2020 and the guy from  call center sad they cannot provide me the statement because it older than 12 months and i told him to log a query so that the IT staff can assist me and he cut off my call... And i am very angry because i need my statement and  i will close of my account with you guys when you cant do a simple thing like a statement while other banks do it... ,1
"I am sooo disappointed with this bank called Africa Bank, someone deposited money into my account willingly now African Bank decided to block my  account without calling me to hear my side of the story what ****es me off is that the person that deposited that money into my account never reported it so I don't understand why they did that ",1
"Some how they stopped the debit orders and now the start deducting and charge me high rates on their *** mistake. and blacklist me. get run touch with me or start getting advocate to lay a case. *** crooks

"My outstanding balance is R190.99 however when I inquire the consultant said I have a settlement balance of  R1615.39. I do not understand where the settlement amount comes from and the consultant said its interests from last year since May, and yet I have been paying the full amount all along, which includes the interest.

African bank deducted R589 from my account this month whereas i am suppose to pay the outstanding balance of R190 and finish off the debt without coming back to me as they have been saying they are investigating for the past 2 weeks. ",1
I have been paying my loan for 12 months but the balance still reflecting I only paid lessthan R3000 of which my Credit profile reflects othr balance,1
"For a Bank that calls itself ""African"" it leaves a lot to be desired. Today I visited African Bank Midrand Bouldes Mall to apply for a loan account. the moment the teller noticed that I was carrying a passport, she suddenly became reluctant to assist me, it was a s if she does not want.  

To cut the long story short the service i received there was so terrible and my application as anticipated was not processed, not because of affordability but simply because my payslip is issued monthly, but i receive my salary twice a month and that for her made it impossible to create the application.",1
"I have applied for credit or loan since the 06th of April 2021 I have submitted every document they say I must submitt, I have been told from last week that the loan application is at the final stage but when I call I get the same feedback that the manager is looking into it. It been over 2weeks since I have applied for a credit but even now no response",1
"After trying to repay a loan within nine(9)months, African Bank seems to want to still grind me into the ground. After repaying R40 000+, they have only given me R5000 off the amount owing. Attempts to try and negotiate have been met by dropped phone calls. Attempts to complain, have been met by more dropped calls. I would just like to chat to a manager that can assist me with a cheaper settlement, as I have cash on hand. Extremely bad customer service, making me resort to complaining here. Sort yourself out African Bank and stop trying to stuff people up. ",1
"A terrible bank. Most unprofessional. No ethics. Waiting for a loan app of mine to be processed. Whatever they asked for I have submitted.  I spoke to a consultant last week when I applied for the loan, she said I will get a response in the afternoon on the same day. Today I call in they said that it takes 5 days for a loan application to be approved. The most slowest and unethical bank.",1
So I've been calling for the past 2 weeks as my account as been put on hold. I advised that I urgently need to use my account so if they can transfer me to that department it would be great for the past 2 weeks I'm being told that the department would call me they would send them an email. This is totally Ridiculous!!! I need someone to sort this out ASAP this is the worse service ever........,1
"2021 and you use a cellphone is authenticate someone any tom, **** or harry can use my phone with my ID number and access my account .

I cant close my account because I don't have access to my phone. I wont pay a single cent more because you guys lack processes to assist customers.
The only bank that doesn't ask security questions.....",1
Don't even try to waist your time to go for a loan. They give you a offer of R200K load debichecks and all and at the end always an excuse happend 5 times to me,1
"POOR SUTOMER SERVICE, I'M A  CUSTOMER FOR AFRICAN BANK I HAD TWO LOANS WHICH I SETTLED BOTH NOW MY PROBLEM IS THAT I HAVE BEEN REQUESTING THEM TO UPDATE MY CREDIT PROFILE AS IT IS NOT UPDATED YET AND THEY ARE SENDING ME FROM PILLAR TO POST TELLING THAT ITS THEIR HEAD OFFICE RESPONSIBILITY.

"The African Bank app is useless to say the least. You complain on the app store, they tell you to email their newabapp email, you don't get a response and have to take time and do transactions at the bank. What is the point of having an app then if you still need to waste money going to the branch? Get your IT department to rather create links which can have us delete and restart the app registration because clearly all our usernames and passwords are incorrect (according to app reviews). Fix the damn bug, this is why people are flocking to banks such as Capitec. It's because of such inconveniences. I am one of the people that live furthest from my nearest branch, I honestly cannot afford the back and forth on matters such as this. ",1
"Im a new customer at african bank. 
And im already very disappointed in the customer service. 
I have applied for the quick 3 min loan proses witch took 2 days after two days sending the documents they required. 
Now 3 days later no reply yet. 
I phoned to find out theres an problem on the employer contact number i gave the new number and they said they updated it. 
Ok so after phoning 3 times no one can tell me whats going on or give me any info.

So now how can i bank with an bank that cant even assit you when calling. 
No replies on emails. 
I even went into the brance and they told me they are waiting for the system to give them update before they can help me. 
This is un acceptable. 
Im cancelling my loan application and closing my account.

"I applied for a loan last week, to date the loan is not approved. I have sent numerous emails with all required documents, I even went to the branch yesterday to physically deliver the documents, I was advised that the loan was approved and would be paid by head office with 1 business day, there is no sign of such. I checked on the app, the loan is still on pending applications. I really applied because I needed money urgently for a funeral, please expedite and advise if it is approved or declined because I have already approved a debicheck on my banking app. I will appreciate it if we finalise everything today as I will need to use the money tomorrow morning.

Online purchase refunded me but African Bank stole my money. Something was bought online and they didn't have stock so they refunded my account but African Bank stole the money. 3 months has passed and no one plans on assisting me.  ,1
"I applied for funds which I needed quite urgent, then I was provisionally offered the funds. I sent all the documents requested to AB docs and copied in the supervisor of the lady assisting me. 3 days later no feedback received. I called for an update the lady just told me someone will call I must wait the final offer is on their system. why is it taking almost a week to finalize the offer ? I emailed the supervisor but they also just ignore the emails. so much for fast and efficient service.",1
"On the 6th of April i generated a Settlement Quote that gave me a specific amount of money to be paid by the 13th of April 2021. I paid that specified amount on the 12th of April 2021. 

Lo and behold, today although my account says it's settled there is now an amount of R 97.00 that is supposedly in arrears. Upon checking my statement it appears i have been charged for 

*Settlement Interest
*Settlement Insurance
*Service Fee

All these charges are post-settlement. What is the point of generating a settlement quote and then charging a customer extra after they think they have settled their debt. I am really disappointed to see that African Bank seems to be intent on gouging its customers of their hard-earned cash.

This is despicable, underhanded & deceptive on your part. ",1
"Please will someone assist

My wife was sent a statement last month advising that her loan will be paid up after the last amount of R439

She then this month received another statement out of the blue with another R586 added to the loan

We tried speaking to the consultants over the phone but they were absolutely awful to try and explain the situation and just kept telling us to pay it.

The lack of customer support is remarkable

Please get this sorted ASAP",1
"Good day
There was a debit order going through that I didn't authorize. It went through debit check. Could you please refund me as I have already an agreement.

I would like to thank African Bank in Pavilion for always giving me excellent service whenever I go the branch. A gentleman by the name of Luvuyo (I think that's the spelling of his name) has helped me resolve my query in such a professional manner. He is one of those guys who would go out of his way to delight a customer's experience. I hope that in the customer service industry we have more delightful staff like to assist with. There is also an elderly African lady who works there who has helped me with another query prior to this. I hope that this review gets to the store manager so he can also acknowledge his staff's excellent service,5
Kindly advise your sales consultants to update the clients information on the system to avoide repetitive calls .....this is very unprofessional thank u ,1

"Dear CEO - Basani Maluleke 

I applied for a personal loan via the online platform in February 2021. It requested me to forward my documents to ***********. I emailed the documents as requested. I received messages stating that I must submit outstanding documents until the credit application expired. I did a new application for the second time on the 24 March 2021. I emailed the required documents to *********** on the 24th and 26 March 2021. I kept receiving messages again requesting the documents. I asked my brother to assist me and we loaded the documents via the online platform on the 27 March 2021. The online banking platform did not allow us to submit the three months bank statement so the others we loaded it under employment confirmation and another employment category. On the 29 March 2021, I asked my brother to send the document again to *********** on my behalf. I then phoned on the 30 March 2021 to  follow up and the gentleman advised me that they would get back to me within 24 to 48 hours. On Sunday the 4 April 2021 I received a SMS that my credit application would expire within a few days. On the 6 April 2021 I requested for a call back, and a lady by the name of Petunia assisted me. I explained my disappointment in the service received and she advised that she would escalate the matter. That same afternoon I was contacted by team leader B Mabuza who advised me that my application is with validations and that they require the March 2021 statement. Now all these documents was submitted and still they wanted the March statement. So emailed it again. Not to mention the SMS's I received requesting me to submit a Visa permit. This was unbelievable because I'm a South African citizen. Today I received a SMS that my that my credit application has expired. Totally bad service. How to do you expect to grow you client base if this is the type of service your staff renders. No zeal for customer service at all. What disgust me is that I had to follow up myself. I would have appreciated if someone had phoned me to give me some sort of feedback to say whether the application was approved or declined, but still no feedback. I hope that you would sort out your staff as they don't have the customer service skills. what a joke. No regard to threat customers fairly. I'm truly disgusted with the way my credit application was handled. I will definitely consult you competition.

"On numerous occasions i was in Durban and had to google and drive around for hours trying to locate an Atm that accepts cash deposits. I challenge you to locate one if you don't know where they are.

And now in Ixopo branch the cash accepting Atm is forever out of order, especially month ends. You are not allowed to do cash deposits in the branch so you have to stand in the half km que outside with only 1 Atm to do deposits. So like many working class people, we choose to do deposits after hours, and 7/10 times its not working. I have sent 3 emails to complain regarding this issue and as yet i haven't received any response or feedback.
For a bank that is growing in SA, surely they should increase the amount of cash accepting ATMs and make sure faults are repaired asap. This past month end the Atm was out of order for 2 days. This is unacceptable!",1
"I received an SMS from my bank to say African Bank authorized a debit order on my account for personal loan

When i called African bank no one could provide me with an answer but was told that they will lodge a case. Am so dissatisfied and worried about my credit record because of such negligence.",1

The African bank customer service is so boring they take long to respond.

"I have a fairly big investment with African Bank which matures in August. To acccommodate the monthly interest from the investment I was advised to open a so-called World Account. On Sunday April 4 I received an sms which indicated that an attempt has been made to withdraw R 5000 from my account. However, it stipulated that a pin was required so that transaction did not go through. But next I received an sms that more than R10000 had been deducted from my account. I made several frantic efforts to contact African Bank, but despite giving my ID and internet banking pin, I was requested to provide yet another pin supposedly sent to my phone. This did not arrive. Only after the 4th attempt was I able to report the situation. I was then told that my report would be “escalated”, and that I would receive a reply within 72 hours. However, I have been extremely inconvenienced and embarrassed by facing an account with virtually nothing in it, from which I normally pay part of my rent. How on earth can African Bank allow a withdrawal without my express consent. This is extremely disturbing. If someone can do a fraudulent transaction from my World Account, what would prevent them from doing it from my big investment? To decide how much to steal from my account someone had to check the balance. I would like to know how is that possible without my password and internet banking pin. This is absolutely scandalous.  It appears that African Bank’s security measures are inadequate, and one can one only conclude that one’s money is not safe with African Bank.

"I would like ti share just how unprofessional African Bank is.On the 12th of March 2021 I tried to apply online for a personal loan, I could not complete my application online and I had to call them. I called them and completed the application telephonically, I was told to send off my documents(bank statement, payslips and ID). I sent the documents on the 12th of March 2021 to the email address I was given by the person who was assisting me. I did not get back a reply to acknowledge the documents. I had to call again to ask if the got the documents, I was told that my ID was outstanding. I resent my ID immediately and still I did not get any reply from them, I had to call again after some days to ask if they got all my documents, I was told they got everything but my application had expired already. Mind you each time I called them I spent about R50 airtime on the calls. Last time I called them I told them I was spending so much money calling them and they don't reply to calls. The lady told me to request a call back online, I did that it's been a full week now I have not gotten a call back from them or to give me any feedback regarding my application.
So all in all I wasted a lot of money trying to bring them business as a potential customer!!",1
Am not happy with the fact that am trying to correct my wrongs but the bank is not letting me. I just need a confirmation letter that proves that I have an arrangement in place for potential employment. Is that too much to ask for? Letter needed by Tuesday. Please.,1
"I have been with African Bank since 2008 and I am a happy customer, overall service received from African Bank is Outstanding.",5
My contract ended at my company last year due to covid ....and before covid i made payment on my account every month with no issues.....then the unthinkable happed ....i spoke to the service provider at African Bank to inform them about what happened and that i undestand that ....the insurance does not cover the claim when a client's contract has ended ....but how do i make payment on my account when i don't have a job!!!!!!......and African Bank does not understand how much presure allot of us are under ...I never once said that i WILL  not pay .... I CAN'T PAY ....because im unemployed.....so if my credited score suffers then fine but once i get a job and i pay my loan in full....then rest a sured i don't want anything to do with them ....i don't want them to call me or send me any sms's nothing ....when i made my monthly payments not once did they call to motivate any of there clients or to thank them for there business because they are heartless.....maybe if i ********** my self to pay them then they will be happy .....,1
African bank is a bunch of sharks. They take money from my account twice in 1 month. They do not stick to the debit order agreement. Please beware of this,1
"So I bought airtime worth R75 on the app,and it showed error that the transaction could not be processed but money was deducted from my account even though I did not receive the airtime,repeated the same process again,still error and another R75 deducted with no airtime received then R50, I need my money back asap else I am taking my salary to another bank next month, this is not the first time this happens, I had to transfer money to Capitec to be able to buy airtime, I don't trust this system anymore",1
It been 6 months I claim against the insurance for lost of income up till today still no response from the insurance department they tell me they will contact me personally I'm still waiting on a call from the insurance department this is the second time I placed a review I get rude calls from the collection department every time I have to explain myself what must I still do to get service ,1
"Every few months my African Bank profile keeps getting blocked. I'm not sure if it's something I am doing wrong? It's frustrating because I need to keep calling in and this time when I did call in I failed my verification. So I need to go to the bank because of your pathetic service. I actually feel like cancelling all my investments with African Bank as you guys are really useless. I need to go to the bank to unblock my profile because of your ""security policy"". Also I was unable to withdraw my money from my 32 day notice from the app so when I tried logging on to my PC after the 3rd attempt my profile got blocked. I would phone in and I would always get assisted however this time the agent kept making some excuse. Wake up!!!! What more does the bank want from me? You already have my money!!!!!!",1
"I applied for a loan with African Bank in January/ February 2021 and it was approved. I opted not to take the loan as my income was going to increase end February 2021. Last night I submitted a loan application again and I was told it was declined due to a judgement on my credit report. I HAVE NO JUDGEMENTS. I called African bank to ask which credit bereaux it was that showed a judgement so I could remedy the error and was given no assistance whatsoever and then cut off.  I have sent emails that have gone ignored, and after attempting to call them again and holding for FORTY SEVEN MINUTES which chewed up all my airtime, someone picked up the phone abs put it straight back down, disconnecting me. My frustration knows no bounds and I am DISGUSTED by the lack of service I’ve received from African bank and if my query is not remedied as a matter of urgency I will be addressing this with the banking ombudsman and making sure everyone on social media knows NOT TO DEAL WITH AFRICAN BANK. It’s disgusting the way people are treated! ",1
We paid money to the correct account number but used the wrong bank. The transaction was from African Bank credit card. We have been calling African Bank to fix this for the past two months with no luck. They keep telling us to give them 7 days to investigate but nothing is being done. ,1
Horrible bank ! I've applied online for a personal loan and it was pre approved. I waited for 4 days with no feedback called in so many times and no answer. Only for me to call them and they tell me that I have to come in. I needed this cash when I asked for it. What a damn inconvenience ,1
" I would like to know when the arrangement changed??????????? I see you guys are debiting me 3 times now, R57 and  2 amounts of R243 and this was never discussed with me.

You sent your Rep or collector here at work when i was missing payments to make payments arrangements with me and I agreed to R243 and another sms was sent to me confirm if i can add R57 to that payment of R243 and I agreed to it and now boom from no where you guys are debiting R57, R243 and another R243 (using a slightly different Ref), you guys are acting like criminals hey - you could have notified and checked if i could afford this... I Need my money back please urgently, my kids are hungry and i need to pay to travel to work, so you can debit me the correct amount at the end of the month.

For the past 3 or 4 months, you guys have been doing your own thing in my amount without my permission and this is illegal. I mean you cannot make an agreement with a client and then just change without notifying the client, you guys are selfish... You are crooks and everyone has been saying this about this bank. You are a bunch of criminals who take advantage of people, the small amount I took, I ended up paying 5 times more without knowing... yeses maan

You will return all 3 or 4 unauthorized debits you took from my account  - i will print out my bank statement.

If this is not sorted, i will stop your payment at my bank, i will go to Hello Peter so you can send your stupid Rep or collector to my home ke... what the heck people

Please sort this our urgently... you cannot just wake up and decide i want to ***** Yolanda's life up... I called your useless call centre, the agent did not assist at all, you guys have my details wrong, so i couldn't be assisted over the phone because of that stupid verification check, like i have the time to go to your branch again for useless results like the one i got in Pinetown next to Spar, stuff with attitude and not helpful at all... absolutely disgusting ",1
"I called in today to enquire about the balance of my account and also to see if i can get a discount on my settlement amount. i was transfered to the debt review department  was on hold for more than 10 minutes thereafter i spoke to a consultant who was so cold on yhe line, telephone etiquette non existant. I told her about what info i require. She kept me on hold for more than 10 minutes,sms coming through advising of a mere 10% discount like really. That is not a discount you just subtracted the interest amount based on the estimated time i would be expected to finish the payment (false advertising ). What even annoyed me was she did not revert back to me to advise she has sent the relevant info via email and sms..i'm busy holding on the line like a retard expecting a response.i resorted to ending call.  I am not impressed at all..you service has dropped. Its like a called a government call call centre  as their service is non existant. I am a client and expert good service . My time, my airtime .you guys dont value your clients period. It shows how we as africans have been reduced  and expected to accept bad treatment  just because majority of your clients are Africans(blacks since thats what we have been qouted as ,even in your application forms)",1

"I would like to lay a formal complaint on the treatment and service I received from Solomon at the Centurion mall branch. I wanted assistance with information regarding the investment options that African Bank offers and options on how best I can save money however Solomon was impatient and not willing to provide me with information I enquired about nor assist in helping me choose the best option to take even after I explained that I don't understand or have much knowledge on how your products work. To show that he wasn't even paying attention he told me I should open an account which I explained to him that my salary is deposited into my world bank account thereafter he replied rudely to say ""in that case go outside and tell them you bank with African Bank"" I was saddened by that response and I immediately stood up and left downhearted and humiliated. I did not get the assistance I requested and I eventually went to Old Mutual and got the assistance and product I was looking for. I'm dissapointed by the service I am receiving from African Bank so much that I am thinking of moving my account to Nedbank as I was told by my colleagues that the client service is superb and professional.",1

"On the 11th March I had a positive balance in my account of R25000, I processed an instant payment to my landlord of R21400 which the banking app indicated had been successful. A half hour later I noticed my balance was still R25000 and that the payment reflected nowhere, not in transactions not on my statement, a little confused, annoyed, I processed the payment again, SAME result!  I waited until 8am when the call centre opened and called the helpline.  They too could not see the transactions and instructed me to do another payment while they were on the line, SAME result! 
I waited until 9am and went into an African bank branch.  Here the consultant processed another payment when I had logged in, both on my phone and on the web, she too was confused at getting the same result!  She called a team leader and logged an issue as she was unaware of any problem and would revert to me later. While sitting with her my landlord called (at that stage laughing) to inform me she had over R160000 in her account paid by me.  Now understand this is IMPOSSIBLE as I have no overdraft nor loan agreement with African Bank so could not have possibly have made such a payment!
Later that evening I received a debit notification for the R21400 and my account reflected the correct remaining balance, so I thought “great” all corrected!
The next day, Friday the 12th, my account reflected a balance of -R157,000.00, ***! And till today this is still the case, African Bank has done NOTHING about it, I have received an sms stating that my account is in overdraft and I must correct it or they will take legal action, I have also received sms’s stating my issue has been resolved, and my recipient landlord has had her account frozen by FNB with accusations of fraud! 
I cannot receive payments I am expecting as they will be put against “my” overdraft and I too have no access to positive funds which should be in the account!
To date I have spent over R300 in phone calls to African Bank, NOT ONCE have they returned a call, I keep being told the case has been submitted to team leaders and forensic departments yet THE CLIENT is being held responsible for what is OBVIOUSLY an African Bank F-UP!!!!!!!
Today I will consult with a Lawyer and send me case to the banking ombudsman!!

I asked that a team leader contact me on the same day and to date I have not received that call. I followed up on the 18 March and spoke to Nyeko and on 23 March spoke to Kanyisa and also asked for the Team Leader to call me. Today (24 March 2021) was the last call and spoke to Bonolo who advised that she doesn't have a response for me but would also escalate for team leader to call me and also tried to transfer me to one.

"I am unpleased by the way African Bank has handled my refund request. 1 March I contacted African Bank requesting a refund for monies paid into their account that ought not to have been paid. They acknowledged receipt of said money and requested I submit proof of payment - which I did. I received a reference number stating that my documents had been received and my request will be processed. 6 March I received a text saying my request has been resolved however, I still did not have my refund. I contacted them 8 March and was informed that it would take up to 48 hours for the money to reflect on my account. That did not happen, instead a week later on 15 March I had to contact them again requesting my refund  - clearly 48 hours has a different meaning at African Bank. I was told some story about how the money was paid somewhere else instead of my bank and that the matter would be escalated. The matter was clearly not attended to with the tone of taking me as a person/client seriously as advocated by the bank. I still do not have my money. 

I am displeased with the service they have shown me in this regard. And I will not recommend them anymore in future. ",1

I was placed under debt review and African Bank never adjusted the interest however I made payments as arranged by debt counselor.  However with the pandemic that happend last year I had a lose of income and send all the documents for the insurance to be paid on the loan . However this was never done and they been charging me compound interest even thou they failed to adjust interest when I went for debt review and the insurance didn't pay my monthly payment. Being harrassed daily. Please do a proper recon on the account and adjust interest correctly as I want to start paying the acc.

"I took up a R8000 loan which was disbursed 2019/05/18. My first D/O was collected 2019/06/20 which I paid until 2019/11/20. I defaulted 2019/12, paid one month's instalment 2020/01/20. I then defaulted 2020/02 (at this point I was one month in arrears for the default payment of 2019/12) and when I received a call at the time I explained to the agent that I had gone through financial difficulty with my late father's illness as I was flying in and out my home town - he passed on in August 2019. I received notification via ITC that this account was handed over 2019/04 (at that stage the account ought to be 3 month's in arrears and could have been collected on). I continued paying via D/O as per arrangement R300 until now where I pay R800 via D/O.

This account is flagged 814 - collections tracing which I do not understand because I've been within reach and I would gladly talk to anyone who calls. Seeing that this account is ""handed over"" I expected 3rd parties to collect on it (Attorneys) and not African Bank itself. 

So are you telling me that after 3 months of defaulting without going through the pre-legal collections process you noted an adverse listing on my ITC over and above the fact that I made payment arrangements and this during hard lockdown when every consumer went through a difficult time.

Why is my account handed over and adverse listing noted when you are collecting? It's either you clear my listing with ITC and I continue paying until settlement.

I am eagerly waiting for feedback from you and I will take this matter to the Banking Ombudsman and lodge a formal complaint with the National Credit Regulator.

No wonder good employees have left your business because your processes are wack.",1
"Hi,

I opened a new African Bank loan account on Wednesday this week, via the online portal.   When the initial debi check mandate arrived, I didn't open it on time and it cancelled out. Then I clicked to try again, and it went through and I do have an active debi check mandate on my FNB banking profile.

Today, I received a phone call from a ""Mike Masango"" from African Bank who was apparently trying to set up the debit order. I replied that I had approved the debi check mandate and he said that it had been cancelled by me.
He knew my FNB bank account number and quoted it to me.  His called me from this number: **********
What was weird was that he then asked for my ""card expiry date"" which I thought was weird for a debit order, and I refused to give it to him. I asked what a card had to do with a debit order as it makes no sense. He told me I could do this, or go into the bank branch myself, which I refused to do.

He got angry with me and threatened to reverse the loan since I need to set up the debit order. I advised that I could e-mail him proof of the debit order mandate and he gave me his e-mail address to do so. He said he would call me back once he receives it.

He gave me this e-mail:   ***********
This e-mail bounces.  I called the number back and then advised it should be ***********, but this also bounced when I tried to forward proof of the debi check mandate there.

At this point, I was suspicious as he did not sound very professional on the phone and the e-mail was bouncing. 
Also, I did not understand what my card expiry date had to do with the loan debit order. 

I then called the African Bank contact centre and an agent helped me to confirm that the debit order was indeed successfully set up.

The reason that I am making this complaint about African Bank is because my data has been shared with a fraudster right after my loan application, so it was an inside job.

This person had my FNB bank account number, my phone number and knew that I had recently applied for a loan and the details of this loan.

This is deeply concerning and I am worried about what they can do with my account details now - even though they don't have all the details.",1
Don't bother with their on line loan applications.  The thing just don't work and keeps on freezing.  And the call back is no help either,1

Are they only running the collecting business, all the care so you pay the account. I ha e lost my job, they don't care however been their customer for donkey years. That's African Bank.

"To Whom It May Concern:

RE: ********** / Account is prescribed

I, Michelle Roma Du Plessis, with I.D. **********087, point and prove my defense of prescription towards my said account.  It is no longer deemed to be active over three years and more than three years.

Therefore, I point out the section extracted in the following words below to you:

As from 13 March 2015 a new section 126B was introduced into the National Credit Act 34 of 2005.

126B.(1)(a)No person may sell a debt under a credit agreement to which this Act applies and that has been extinguished by prescription under the Prescription Act, 1969 (Act No. 68 of 1969).

126B(1)(b)No person may continue the collection of, or re-activate a debt under a credit agreement to which this Act applies -

(i) which debt has been extinguished by prescription under the Prescription Act, 1969 (Act No. 68 of 1969); and

(ii) where the consumer raises the defence of prescription, or would reasonably have raised the defense of prescription had the consumer been aware of such a defense, in response to a demand, whether as part of legal proceedings or otherwise.""

I instruct the account to be closed with no further proceedings by you, as the arrears have not been collected within three years since the last payment on your record.

Should I not hear from you within 7 days from this date of delivery of this content, I consider the case to be closed.  Again I draw you to the clause (i) snd (ii).

Regards,

Michelle",1

She said there was an error which she will log with IT and should be fixed during the week and when I get an sms I should download the app and return to collect card, got the SMS on the 23/02/21.

Went back to the Branch on Friday the 25/02/21 only to be told it’s not fixed because she never followed up with the right people. The same person was blatantly rude, I asked to log a complaint or speak to the manager, she said I can sms to the number that’s on the wall, another agent showed me the manager who listened to my query, made a call. I then received an sms saying it will be fixed in 72hours and it will be communicated to me via SMS to come. The person on the call confirmed that too.
Today is the 05/03/21. Nothing has been done.

I had a choice of other banks for my savings but choose yours and I get treated like this on first hand, that’s left a very bitter taste in my mouth. I’m a very professional person who deals with clients daily, the kind of behavior African bank staff in that branch have is intolerable.

This are my numbers should you wish to revert back to me **********, hopefully there’s a few competent people working for the company.

"My father died the end of September. It firstly took African bank 5 months to make contact. How could they expect us to know all his accounts? 
They have called me 5 times the last week to ask when we are paying. I asked what the debit order error said. their reply was, deceased. That is really not too hard to understand, is it? 

I waited two days for them to supply me with the info to submit the deceased forms. After I sent that, I was contacted 2 times again to ask for payment. 
Seems when it comes to certain companies, the dead may not rest in peace. 
Never shall I do business with African bank.",1
Good Day. I just received a call about my loan accounts I asked the lady that she does not see that I am unemployed I did sent my UI19 to African Bank and that I have been waiting to date in total 60days now for my UIF payment so I cant make any payments and explained to her that I did tell the previous person I spoke to that as soon as I get money I will contact them and make cash payments as agreed. That she has the cheeck to ask me is there no way someone can can give me money to make payments???? So yes i screamed at her and asked her if she can hear that im at home with my youngest and that i have two other children at school so how the hell will i ask someone for money to make payments as I would rather ask for money for my childrens well being. Uterly STUPID QUESTION TO ASK ME!!!!! AND GET THIS STRAIGHT MY CHILDRENS WELL BEING IS MORE IMPORTANT NOW THEN PAYING MY ACCOUNTS I DID NOT ASKED TO BE WITHOUT A JOB !!!!!,1
"My wife has a consolidated loan agreement with African bank. She wants to settle the account and called the operator. The operator informed her that she cannot settle the account which she has for almost two years now. This is it the first time that we heard that a loan amount cannot be settled. Instead, she was told that she can pay half of the loan and that her montly payment can then also be halved but the term will remain the same. This is a total ripoff. Please assist, help or give advise where i can report the institution.",5
"Uou send me a a reply on Hello Peter which I'm unable to view.

"They take the whole week to process a mere loan application. Poor service delivery, their online system sucks, Today i visited a branch in Phumulani Mall only to find one of their employees shouting at a customer, they are very rude and i didn't get assisstance.",1
I have applied for a loan last week sunday they phoned me Monday and said I was pre approved. Then on tuesday they asked for the payslip bank statements id etc I sent through someone phoned me and said I was approved for certain amount and it would be in my account within 2 working days. When I phone thursday they said that loan was pre approved and it waiting for confirmation of employment but they did phone and the numbers are not work. I then gave them the correct numbers as the line are off. Eventually after about 4 calls they captured correct number. I phoned this week Monday or tuesday where they said that confirmation is done and they will phone me the following day to finalise. When i phoned following day they said that they still waiting for confirmation for employment. It is pathetic service you need money and think its been approved but then its this and that and nobody is much help,2
"I have changed my banking details which I called in to African bank and I have changed it with them. I called in to ask If I may have a letter with not even 20 words just stating that I have made arrangements to pay my account every month from that banking account and the amount I will be paying, First I get told they don't give such letters, Then I get told only after 3 months when I called again do they give such letters, then by another consultant I was told my debit did not go off last month that's why they cant give me a letter ? So clearly its laziness to type out a letter as I get different excuses everytime. Oh and the lady at a branch told me Banks don't give such letter, My dear if I should go to my bank now asking for a letter I will get it they will try and assist as best as they can , not bull**** me .

I have payment arrangements with African Bank and they just decided to deduct original amount instead of arranged amount. This has really left me stressed as I am still working short time due to Covid. Sent them e-mails and nobody is responding. ",2

Yesterday was the 3rd and last time African Bank takes me for a fool. I have been battling with these voucher that they issue as rewards. They sent me 3 times a incorrect voucher, when i went to go and buy at Checkers the voucher dont work.

"I've banked with many banks in SA all promising ""great service and reachable but ever since I joined the AB team I've never been happier from the consultants at the branch to the CS on the phone and the social media team y'all deserve a million star reviews. 

I would also urge that your consultants at the branches to refrain from using their phones while talking to clients as I had this occasions in Khayelitsha mall and Mowbray branch when I had to repeat what I've said because the consultant was on her phone.

Either than that I'm happy I know that I'm in the best reliable bank that I know I save my money and get paid R150 just for swiping only which NO OTHER BANK DOES",5
"I have a loan and credit card debt with African bank which I pay when I am working and don't pay when I'm not employed. I always call and make these arrangements because I always get contract employment. So the last time I paid them was end of 2019, in 2020 I did not work so I couldn't pay. Now I am being offered employment in the financial industry which requires me to pay all my debts or have an arrangement in place, I approached African bank to make an arrangement that from the first month of my employment I will pay and they refuse to make an arrangement with me. And I won't be employed if I don't have an arrangement with them, so how does African bank expect me to pay them if I'm unemployed?? ",1
Apparently African bank cannot restructure the loan if the client has financial issues. I have explained to the consultants that I am unable to pay the full instalments anymore but unfortunately there is no way they could help me. The payment arrangement is not reducing the balance because of the high interest. I really want to off the loan but the interest is making it impossible for me.,1
"So I have a loan with african bank,which I've been paying for 8months now,the loan was 13000 and now is 11000 which means I payed 2000 for 8months?I'm paying this loan 770 each month,now it's March I payed but the statement says there was a reversal which I don't know about,my I'd is **********086 please can someone look into my matter and get back to me.",1
"Very bad service, going through Covid and being put on short time, I requested the bank to bring down my debit orders, it wasn't done, eventually, I went and saw someone inside a branch who helped me. 
However, this person after 3 months never made contact with me again although I reached out to her. Then in Jan, I open another bank account called African Bank gave them the details made a payment commitment. Receiving a call from a law person that said he was sent by  African bank to come and see me for payments arrangements. I told him but I have proof of all my SMS's that a commitment was made. Again didn't go off this month, same threatening calls. I then went through my bank details well well well, they have incorrect bank details and no knowledge of my SMS's. Now how do I receive an SMS from your company and you don't have a recording so fit! this is pathetic. The lady has now taken down my details again. ",1
"I had a loan with African Bank in 2017. I paid them in 2018. They said i had an outstanding amount that I therefore paid this year.
I have contacted their call centre and gone to their branches in Menlyn and have requested they updated on ITC that i have since paid the outstanding amount on the previous loan i had with them.
African Bank has been taking me from pillar to post and not giving me the correct information as to why they did not even update that i made a payment in 2017 at the time was 90% of the payment.
I have retailers that updated my payment nut they have seemingly dont know how to update with ITC this has been going on for 3 years and i dont understand why they will not update my details.",1
"Dear African Bank i have a personal loan as well as a credit card with you. I have called countless times as well as spoken to maybe 3 different consultants. I need settlement letters asap. If i don't get it, how will i pay you? Is it that hard to get a settlement letter? Why do you want to keep me in bondage? I want to settle and i will use this to defend my case that i have offered to settle but no settlement letter was provided after asking countless times.",1

"This is the worst bank ever. Due to COVID-19 I made payment arrangments as I could not pay the full amount of my loan. I spoke to a consultant last month and we cofnirmed on an amount, they this agreement will be for the next 3 months. She said she will log this on the system. Today when getting my banking app, they pulled of the full amounts of the loan now I cannot pay my car and house. Trying to contact them but no answer. It is not that I don't want to pay, I am still paying on my installment.

This is really bad service from this bank. Will never recommend them to anybody.

"Tryna pay off my loan with African was a hassle on it's own, but I finally did in January. I got a confirmation letter for paying off my loan. This morning after logging into my banking app I see African Bank my upcoming payments for the very same settlement amount I paid last month. Why though?!!!! This is another level of incompetent.

"I had 2 loans from African Bank and have been under Debt Review since 2017. I paid off both loans in December 2020 and January 2021 respectively. However, when I checked my Credit Reports on Transunion, Experien and ClearScore etc., I noticed that African Bank had listed my payments as missing, late, or in arrears for more than half of the time I was on Debt Review. Except for the time I Joined the Debt review in 2017, I only skipped 1-2 month during the lockdown.

When African Bank agreed to the Debt Review process, they should have adjusted their system so that the new Debt Review payments are taken as full installment. But African Bank had my accounts always on arrears since 2018, and on Credit Reports, those accounts always appear as in arrears/missing or late by 60 days 150 days each, yet they were receiving payments every month.

This seems unfair as they should have taken into account I was under debt review. At the same time, I also had FNB credit and FNB overdraft, and they NEVER even listed those two accounts on Credit Bureaus. Both FNB accounts appear as ""NOT UPDATED"" from 2017 and when I paid off the FNB credit card account, they just said ""Account Closed"". Why can't African Bank do the same since I was under debt review.",2

I got the call from african bank Saturday  stating that they are responding to the review I wrote to Hello Peter I  told them the same thing I have been telling their collection team and those who says they are from african bank head office and on Friday I e -mailed   letter again for now I'm still waiting to hear from them ,1

"Dear non-customer service at African Bank
This morning 20/02/2021, my My World profile was missing from my internet banking as well as my mobile apps. I contacted the call centre on ********** and entered all my details as requested. A lady picked up my call after 16 minutes and I explained the reason for my call. She put me through to My World. After 24 minutes of holding on, I contacted Loan applications who responded within 1 minute! I just wanted to check whether anyone was working at African Bank! This gentlemen then advised me of a technical issue at African Bank, something that we as customers had not been advised of.

Herewith my suggestions to improve your non-customer service:
1. You have SMS and email details of all your customers. Do us the courtesy of advising us of technical issues so we do not panic and flood your branches and call centres with enquiries.
2. Update your call centre staff to advise immediately of a technical issue.
3. Update your IVR to advise callers of your technical issue to reduce unnecessary queues.

Not rocket science, just plain customer service.

I am really disappointed with African Bank. My dad made an online application for a loan he sent all he paper work. He waited and waited when he phoned them they said he must send all the docs again cause they lost it. He sent it again yet he still waited and waited it has been more than a month now. Last week my dad went to African Bank in Somerset West when enquired about the loan they said they haven't received anything. So my dad made the loan inside the bank it was approved and everything and he was told it would take 3 to 4 working days. Yet today is a week and a day still nothing and no one can help him no one knows anything when he phone Customer care they Wana sell other **** to him so what the actual ****. You say oh come make a loan we are the quickest to give a loan you get it quickly with no hassel. Ja right it's a ****ing joking. Why can you get a loan at any other bank quicker. You apply you get approved and get money the same day so why does African Bank take their sweet time even though they falsely advertise they are the quickest but my dad applied 3 times and it over a month. No man it's not right get you act together. Do your job,1
"African bank is a bunch of **** useless , incompetent and thief bank.
Firstly there is no arrears 
Secondly i receive a settlement to settle the account by end of February .
From  last year June till now I have had enough I had numerous calls numerous complaints nothing seems to be happening every time they debit your account more than the initial agreement then they advise it was an error .
C'mon now how the hell to you do this error everytime it's like insanity repeating itself because this incompetent thief bank still keeps stealing money from your account. 

I have had enough I need someone in authorative level to phone me and help me close this account because it seems that everyone dont know what is happening. 

I urge everyone please do not take anything from african bank please I beg you guys .

If you dont have something do without it this bank here is the most useless,incompetent bank I have ever came across they will debit you twice month end plus even middle of the month without hesitation .

Absolutely disgraceful bull**** piece of **** bank .

I will never recommend my worse enemy to this bank",1
"On the 29 Jan went to African bank soshanguve crossing mall to apply for a loan of R45000. The consultant that assisted me there did everything and took all documents needed. Surprisingly 30minutes after I left the bank I got a call from her to return back to the bank because head office need my fingerprints,I returned back on the arrival she requested that I insert my bank card  and enter my pin,she said it failed so she used my phone to accept messages send,did the fingerprints and it failed,we tried it four times but it failed,so we agreed she will call me so i return the next day to finish the process as it was pending. About 45minutes later money was paid into my account and got a message it will reflect in my FNB Acc after 2 days, few minutes later got a call and it started African bank office (David Sipho Khumalo) **********. He said thank you for visiting one of our branches today, he is doing a performance rating  survey, he asked how I assisted am I satisfied or not with African bank services, who helped me,how much do I rate the person from 1 - 10. He said African bank would like to offer me an airtime for being a good customer as this is not my first time applying for a loan with them so I should dial:*35*0000# to  claim my airtime and I did just that. 30 Jan late i realized that my phone says Emergency calls only and I could not call or receive calls, get messages or send out messages. My husband advices me to checking my banking app if it's working I found out 3 different transactions were done on my account on the 29 Jan. At 18:23 purchase to BARTER SHOP R23000, at 18:25 purchase to Old mutual money account R2000 and at 18:27 purchase to BARTER SHOP  R20000. On the 31 Jan went to FNB ATM to block my card and also called the FNB fraud department  to report the case,as the money was still pending. Went to MTN to do a SIM SWAP only to found out the person did a SIM SWAP on the 29 Jan,meaning he was receiving my calls and messages when the bank send OPT pin for the transactions he can authorize them. So FNB refuse to refund the money because they say I authorized the transactions,but I told the when I reported the case  that my phone was blocked. As I speak to you now I owe African bank R45000 that I did not used or spend. I reported the case to African bank no response or update from them.

"2011 June I put all my credits to administration I got the court letter to give to all my creditors which include african bank last year I got the letter from my administration stating that all my creditors are paid and I got the letter from the court again stating all is settled, right after that african bank stated calling me after after 9years saying I need to pay them 7800 I told them I got a E74 stating all my creditors from administration are settled they said I should take take letter to my nearest african bank which I did to two different branches, even today they call me 4 to 5 times a day saying I still owe them this is really stressing me now and disturbing me at work you keep on saying the same thing but nothing changes ",1
"I have never experienced such a terrible service like the way I had with African bank this week, they are behaving like I am doing application for the first time with them. I made a application for a credit on Monday for loan, after that I was told to submit supporting documents as they have mentioned and to the email adress as they said, I sent the documents three times but still they keep saying that they never received documents, I fail to understand how come because it's the same email address that I was told but there is no feedback, it's been more than 48 hours waiting for the feedback, they wasted my time of waiting, if they told me once that they cnt help me than delaying me so long like this, if I knew I should have gone try somewhere,  they are been unprofessional and ignorant for their clients, I wonder why such a terrible service because all the accounts I had with them I paid them up without outstanding,  I feel like they wasted my time, it's been three days without without feedback, this is worse than ever, I never expected such from the institution I settled all the accounts with them, all the information they keep asking me I did send them but no feedback. Why African bank becoming a terrible institution like this? Is it having new management or it's their poor system or illiterate consultants who cnt do their work? I have applied credit before, I was replied on the same day but this time is been more than 48 hours with excuses of missing documents that I sent three times. I am so ****ed because they wasted my time with no service at the end. If they ddnt want to help me they should have said it than wasting my time.",1

"I had such high standards of this bank so far but for my partner it's quite the opposite! My partner applied for a loan 6 days ago and sent in all the documentation needed for it. He was contacted on Monday (15/02/2021) to finalize and was said to be paid out within the next 24 hours. It has been a frustrating journey for him talking to several consultants and nobody actually doing their job right. the online webchat agents Dinah and Lebogang are also useless as they say ""sorry, I can't help you, you need to call this number..."". I also use to work in the webchat department and would call my customers back if they requested that option. So far bad bad bada experience for him.

Now again we are at this point, I go to the branch and now they cannot load my biometrics on their system. Making it the 5th time that I have gone to the branch. I then called the call centre again for the 20th time in 2 weeks and they said I have to go to home affairs. WHAT!!!!!! Why must I go to home affairs if your system does not work. I am so frustrated as everytime at the last step of African Banks very lenghty process I fail. I am not happy about this at all and the service has really been very bad from AB side.

"In 2019 I went into debt review, and 2 accounts from African Bank was added to the review. I paid my account to review company diligently every month.
Unfortunately I was retrenched by October 2020 and have been unemployed since. I still paid the account to the review Co. Now my money ran out and I could not. 
What bothers me now is that I have been receiving numerous calls from African Bank for non payment of account. I have sent through proof that I was retrenched to the review company. Still African Bank is calling me even telling me that I have made an arrangement to pay them, which I did not and would not. I keep on informing them to call the review company, but African Bank still calls me..... 
This must stop. Times are stressful enough being unemployed and not finding work. And not being able to even put food on the table or being able to buy any other stuff. I have other accounts at other institutions which is also part of the review and they not even calling me. Stop this African bank now. ",1
I am so unhappy  with  the  manner  in which African  bank  treats  customers. I settled  my loan  in March 2020 and paid  off the 18 036 debt and still had  to fight to get them to allocate  the  payment.Now this year 2021 I just  found  out that they haven't  updated  my credit profile with  the credit bureau  to show  that I have  indeed paid so my credit  profile  still  has  an adverse listing .I have  been sending  emails  to get  them  to update  and  the sad  part is some emails are ignored  and  the last  lady I spoke  to couldnt  explain  to me why  this  payment  wasn't  updated  with credit bureau. ,1
"I have been made to sign an agreement to pay R 471.51 which I have been paying.

She further tells me I must phone the bank to make other arrangements. The amount I'm paying to them is what I can afford. Currently this bank isn't even acknowledging money paid this them. No updates made to my credit record suggesting I'm not contributing a thing. I was told they'll be crediting back the money in 72hrs. Now it's way pass that and nothing. I want my money back, they must stop debiting my acc as if they have shares in it!!",1
"I have tried to open an African Bank Fixed deposit account on behalf of an employee and due to certain difficulties that I had, I sent them an email on the 9th of February.  To date, I have had no response other that the standard ""a consultant will get in touch with you"" email. Today I phoned them and got transferred from one consultant to the next.  If this is how African does business, then I don't know if my employee should invest money at this bank.
I see African Bank does not respond to any of these complaints either so I guess I will advise my employee to go elsewhere.  Amazing how institutions such as these can afford to lose money.",1
"Terrible bank!! I called them on the 9th Feb 2021 at 08:05am and told them to close my loan account as it is settled. They messaged me on the 10th Feb saying thank you for your request to close your loan account!

What happened for that 30 hours or so? No I have to wait longer because of uneducated employees?!

I am an unhappy customer from day one!",1
"How is it possible for an organization the size of African Bank can Employ consultants who cannot speak English properly?

I have been a credit card customer of African Bank for many years now, during October 2020 I moved my current bank account, I e-mailed African Bank and advised them to change my bank details for debit order purposes. The debit order went of my new bank account once....and never again (I confirm there is/was enough money in this new bank account)
Today I received a call from the most arrogant individual ever, and to top it all he cannot speak English properly. I asked him why the debit order is not going off. Unfortunately he cannot answer as the language barrier is to big.

So, can African bank please send me the total outstanding amount on my credit card, as well as the details of whereto a can pay (EFT) this money. I would like to settle this card and never deal with these bunch again. 

Many thanks

"Was rebntrenced 2020 July just after companies opened in level 4 lock down. Still stressed thinking about debts, emailed the letter retrenchment to all my creditors including African Bank. After some time received the call acknowledging receipt but that was the end of it.

While am busy stressing how am I gonna get out calls from African Bank did not top and kept on explaining the same thing... Hello have been retrenched and am still waiting African Bank. Remember the high interest and other charges I pay it has insurance incase I do not have income. 

I got tired of follow up and the calls and arrangement of 1000 made..... Remember I come dololo however African Bank does not care. With the million explains that you give a consultant it still does not mean anything you owe. I have been with African Bank, had loans settled and in a way was. Or am still their customer as I owe. 

What really made me angry. Money was deposited in my account and thez African Bank debited 5285 in January 2021,fine lady Patricia called and same explanation how can you debit 5285 while so many times I explained and the arrangement is 1000.and till today African Bank never cared with the million emails sent. Again end January African Bank debited 1000 which lady Patricia did not see that you are making arrangement for the same month that I already paid. Upon requesting for reversal of only the 1000 as am short answer was its not possible, resend  the letter of retrenchment to al the emails then they will take iit from there

Tull today no response, have done more than 10 follow ups. All am requesting reverse the othe r amount double debited so that I can have food and rwnt and school fees

This morning sent another follow up as am stressed. At 2 am as I cant sleep. Need the money double debit. Still no response. Settled credit card. Am still doing follow up of settlement letter. Companies we trust that they will be there in times of need ",1
"African Bank doesn't update my paid up loan
I was given a settlement offer and I settled, but they only updated the difference and not the full loan amount being paid off, it still shows as owing on my credit profile.

Please sort it out urgently ",1
"African Bank is such a beginner. Untrained staff that cannot answer your questions and most disturbing NO MANAGERS in the branches. This is so unprofessional it is not even funny and not only that but it places the poor staff members in the branch at disadvantage.
To make matters far worst I complained to African Bank about the absence of Mangers in the Branches to which they kindly emailed me a letter informing me that my concerns have been raised with the manager and that the matter is therefore resolved.
Naturally I understood that a manager must have been appointed since my complaint, so I go to the branch to meet this new manager.
Only to discover that there has not been a manager since my complaint, and that there most certainly not been a new one appointed.
THIS DEAR READER BRINGS ME TO THE CONCLUSION THAT AFRICAN BANK PAYS NO ATTENTION WHATSOEVER TO YOUR COMPLAINTS.
THEY JUST INSULT YOUR INTELLIGENCE AND SEND YOU AN AUTOMATED REPLY TO ANY COMPLAINT.
Honestly they should go back to the drawing board as their entire system is unfriendly and useless.
AVOID THESE BEGINNERS THEY NOT WORTH THE AGGREVASION TO SAVE A RAND OR TWO ON BANKING FEES.

I am requesting immediate approval for a loan amount of R9000. Also I don't have any loan with African Bank, there system is still picking up something which they also never cleared or corrected with the legal department as I have received paid up letters from the collection company and African Bank itself. 
I have escalated this matter to the Financial Ombudsman and NCR of unfair practices. 

So I don't want to hear that I can't get a loan because of something which should have been fixed 3 years ago already.

"In September 2020 I completed the form online on the African Bank website to open an account using my infants details so I can start a 5 year investment.

In January 2021 I received a bank statement for December via email. The statement showed a my world account number which I used to deposit money into. I also used the option on the website if the bank statement to deposit R20 000 .

R1 000 using my Capitec Bank on 8 January
R10 000 using the African Bank website
R10 000 using the African Bank website

I went to the branch to confirm that the deposit worked. The branch could not assist because the system wanted the fingerprint of my infant which were never taken as the account was opened on the website. 

I sent a message to Facebook African Bank, they day there's no money in the account. It has been 3 weeks since I went to the branch and they haven't called me back like they said. 

I need the money to be returned urgently as I could have been earning interest on it everyday it is missing.

Can you please escalate the refund to be done urgently as it's not my issue the poorly designed system of African Bank allowed a child born in 2020 to receive a statement and deposit on the website. I noted at the branch the ID Number of the child says the child is born in 1920 instead of 2020. Return the funds NOW and fix your system at your snail pace without inconvenience to me. You should actually write me a thank you voucher for helping you discover deficiency on the work of your developers.

"I have been under debt review since 2015. Unfortunately in 2017 I was retrenched so I could no longer meet my payments. 
But, I now realise that the credit card is still being charged insurance which covers retrenchment. The letter was sent to African bank back then. Why was this not written off. 

Also I had a loan. 
Principal Debt - R18 640.00
Payments Made - R 21 746.83
Insurance - R 2 665.34
Interest R 16 704.28

This one also had insurance, but with retrenchment the debt was not covered?
The agreed interest rate on this loan was 32.65%. On debt of R 18 640.00 the interest should have been R 6 085.96 and not R 16 704.28?

"Good Morning,

I took out a loan with African Bank and have been paying 4320 every month since Dec 2019. The difference betweeen starting amou till currently is merely R10000 but have paid more than R50000.

"I have applied for an African bank loan approximately 10 years ago. The loan was approved Instantly and I was approved for a credit of R32000 on a salary of R4000 a month.

I had accepted the loan as I needed the money, but since I took the loan I wasn't able to meet the repayments of ±R1800 a month.

Eventually after a few years I received a call, requesting payment arrangements and I had advised that I am no longer employed and so on, the consultant had asked me for my documentation to put through a claim for the insurance to pay off the credit as there was an insurance available on my loan and credit card.

I had submitted all the required documents and was then called up the next month for payment again. When I questioned the Insurance process, I was advised that it was not possible for me to claim for insurance as my contract has ended and was also advised that I will not be charged anymore interest on my credit card neither on my loan, so whatever I pay towards my credit card will bring my balance down by that amount and same for my loan until it has been paid off. So I tried to pay R50 a month to each of which on some months i wasn't able to pay anything, and after I've been re-employed I've been making arrangements to pay a minimum of R100 a month towards each account.

Since then I've been making a minimum payment of R100 per account on a monthly depending on how much extra i have for a month.

I have also tried undergoing debt administration at that point but had the order rescinded about 3 years later as the administrator was barely paying anything to any of my creditors and did not negotiate any amount with any of my creditors neither bring my balances down by what would have been expected to have been sitting at after the time of checking up with my creditors directly.


So anyway , I've been reading about African Banks reckless lending this morning, of which I somehow didn't seem to be aware of at the time of the matter going on. 

I pretty much believe that I am also a client of African Banks reckless lending as the credit approved wasn't logical compared to my earning at the time. I have been paying African bank since 2016 yet my credit was approved in 2010/2011.

Was I not supposed to have been one of those clients whose debt supposed to have been written off at the time of the reckless lending issues been resolved by African Bank?

Is there anything that I can do now to have this debt written off as  it was a reckless lending credit and its been ±10 years already and its still sitting at R48400 ",1

I lost my job last year during the first national lockdown went to African bank to alert them that I won’t be receiving salary anymore since I lost my job they asked for the unemployment letter of which I gave them  to claim for the insurance since I been paying for it when I took out the loan. But I’m receiving calls everyday to make payment and I’m told that I need to send that letter every months. Why is that  ,1
"I had a personal loan with African Bank in November 2017 and understood all the terms and conditions and all the additional monthly charges that came with it. In April 2018 I was retrenched and I submitted all my relevant documentation to claim from the insurance. I received 2 SMS' confirming that my claim was processed. I then thought my debt was cleared... Only to be notified a year later some time in July 2019 that I have one installment outstanding and the arrears interest, service fee, VAT on charges and insurance fee was hiking up my outstanding amount from R981.46 to R2182.58 currently. I went to my nearest branch and the lady informed me that even though my claim was processed, I was suppose to come to the branch and bring my documents to update my unemployment status after that, which I had no clue of, because no one mentioned it. I was so shocked! I made a payment arrangement in from October 2019 for R200 per month, but because of all the monthly charges, my balance was not decreasing and I then laid a complaint with African Bank in November 2019, asking why I have to pay for insurance when I do not have the loan any longer. African bank then did nothing to solve the issue and I decided to stop payments in December 2019. I noticed that they only removed the monthly insurance charges from my statement in June 2020 and I started with my payment arrangement again in September 2020 of R200 per month. I have been paying since September 2020 to date and increased my payment to R300 in December 2020. Even though I am paying more monthly the balance is trickling very slowly down, because I am paying approximately R123.00 just for interest, fees and charges. I think to date I have paid approximately R1800.00 in total, when I only owed less than R1000, but I still have debt of over R2000 with African Bank, struggling to pay it off. I feel unfairly treated and extorted with my money through monthly charges. I know African Bank can do something to  reduce my amount of debt, but no has solutions at the Bank.",2
"I just cant believe how this people work. i wrote a review last year regarding my account that is overdue according to African Bank, when i lost my job i took all my documents into the meyerton branch so that my insurance can pay out for the money i owed as i lost my job. now they keep on taking the money from my account after a lady phoned me the last time and she stated that she will stop the direct debit until all thee problems has been sorted. now they still did not sort the problem and they still take money every month on different amounts just so that the direct debit is different. how does this work that you phone and you say you will sort it and then couple months later you dont inform me in what is going on and you just do the direct debit. im really to my end now and now i want to get a lawyer so that they can sort this problem out, i will make sure that all expenses goes to African Bank as they just dont care. is it my fault that the African Bank workers cant do their job. i explained to the lady the last time that when i took my documents in about what 7 8 years back the lady still stated that i dont need to stress as the insurance will pay out for everything. and now after all this years now one of a sudden the insurance has not been paid out. 
i demand that i get feedback regarding this matter and i also demand that you stop the direct debit until you have sorted this problem out. im so tired to always contact African Bank but they cant make any effort to keep one up to date. please African Bank sort this **** out now as this has been going on for to long now.",1
Why does African Bank debit my account 2 times in one month. I hate this especially during tough times like this and this is the second time they are debiting my account 2 times now. They have literally no authority to debit my account the second time but yet they do. Then they promise to refund my money back to me then they conconct a bs story about why they cannot refund and all they do is apologize that's all and not come up with a solution or say that they won't tell me they will skip a payment given the double debit and one cannot reverse the debit order either. African bank better come back to me with a solution or else I will be taking matters further. This is ridiculous and pathetic that they are doing this now again!!!!!!!!,1

I've logged the problem with African Bank on Sunday, 17 Jan (ref: **********) with a promise ""We will provide feedback within 72 hours"". Needless to say, the 72 hours lapsed and I had ABSOLUTELY NO feedback from African Bank. This morning I also phoned African Bank for feedback, using the same reference nr and was told that it's been escalated and that African Bank would ""phone me within the next hour"". It's now more than 12 hours later and  I still haven't received any feedback. In the meantime, I've discovered that African Bank put my MyWorld account on hold (freeze) and did not even had the decency to notify me or give me a call. It's really a shame because my wife and I invested more that R6m in African Bank and are being treated like this. Once the problem is resolved, I'll close all my African Bank accounts and will invest my money with a reputable financial institution. 
Think twice before investing your money with African Bank!",1
"You guys are pathetic why the hell am I being debited for accounts which was settled on the 2nd  of December????

Worse of all the one loan was not even closed on the bureau yet the credit card was closed and is still debiting!!!!!! 

You need to cancel those card authorised debit orders and remove the debt on the bureau immediately. I am also expecting written communication to confirm both these actions, I cannot fathom the level of incompetence associated with you adopting the card authorised debit orders which you clearly do not understand how to operate!!!",1
"African bank customer service is appalling! All I called in for was to change my banking details. But instead the first advisor placed me on holding for a while waiting for her system as she said. I dropped the line after waiting on hold and called again, 2nd advisor went silent on me after asking security questions, I was left speaking to myself! Sll this over wanting to change my banking details!!!!!!!",1
"Their call centre has been trolling and spamming me with phone calls with loan offers that I have rejected. I received over 40 calls on Friday, over 20 calls on saturday and also on Sunday. Each time I ask that they update their details to note that I am not interested only to receive more call from them.

I am all for proactive marketing, however this is now harassment.",1
"Pertunia Tshikolomo, you the Best Thank you. ",5
"I have stayed up to date with my loan payments. Even during Covid periods where the credit protection was meant to cover payments, My debit orders still went off and I went through the continuous battle of getting my funds refunded. 

On the 5th of January I got a call from African Bank asking me if all is in order with my salary dates again, confirming my banking details and contact details and reminding me of when My January debit order will be going off - no problem. Not once was it mentioned that there is a short payment on my account - which would make NO sense as my account is on a debit order and has never failed. 

Then this weekend I receive a LEGAL NOTICE tell me that I need to settle an outstanding amount within 10 days. Now if I owe money - which I don't understand - then I will take responsibility and pay it. But how dare you send a LEGAL NOTICE without once making me aware that there is an outstanding amount on my account. 

This bank is disgusting and treats it's clients like rubbish!   ",1
"African did not contact me . Still waiting for their response on my complain about statement that I need.

"I cannot begin to explain my distress with this company , initials I owed a loan and a credit card , a couple of years ago I went to pay off my Credit card because I was just frustrated by the intrest I was getting on it and I just wanted to get rid of it , I was offered a discount and choose to close it , after fighting with them as I kept getting messages that I still owe both credit card and loan they closed the Credit card according to my understand , I was unemployed for a while and I could not afford to pay off the loan , last year in June a consult called me as they were calling me the whole time asking me to pay something I eventually decided to pay as I had found a job c, they told me I owed R6000 and offered me a discount which at the time could it afford and I said I would just continue with monthly payment , I have been paying off R6000 for the past 6 month , mind you Novermber was debited twice as I just checked my stament now hoping I’m done with them and guess what lol I still owe R5000 to date , when I tried clearing the fact that I had closed off the credit card not the loan they said it was the loan and they couldn’t do nothing about it , I wouldn’t advice anyone to get financial help from them , I’m so so disappointed and if I could I would reverse all the money I paid and remain in debt because it’s all the same !!",1
"Handled my complaint so well, an agent immediately called me after complaining on hello per and my insurance was processed, my installments were immediately paid. Thank you for taking your time in resolving my query",5
I would like to thank African Bank Hillcrest for amazing service. Never in my life have I received such amazing polite and efficient service. I applied for a loan and within 24 hours it was approved and paid into my account. There were some problems with my application and the consultant phoned me several times until it was resolved. I could not believe the care I received. Never in all the years I have been on this earth have I ever received the service I did from Hillcrest African Bank. Thank you you are the BEST! ,5
"Good day

African Bank on the 14/01/2021 at 23:23 debited R257.10 without my consent. My debit order date is the 25th of every months.

Why have I been debited yesterday? ",1
This Bank put through a debit order of  R3285 on my account without permission!!!  I have never agreed to that.  We had a previous arrangement and they chose to ignore that and put through the whole amount without my permission!! I am a pensioner and my husband has lost his job during the Covid-19 pandemic!!! I think this is absurd and the public may loose all faith and trust in this Bank if this is the way they operate.! This action leaves me with nothing in my account!  If necessary I will refer this matter for further legal action!!!!,1

"I went onto African banks website to review their range of services. I interacted with a Bot. The first positive thing was the upfront acknowledgement that I was interacting with a Bot. After a while I requested to be referred to a Human - within a few minutes I  received a call. My questions were intelligently answered. 5 minutes after this call, I received another, checking that I had been adequately serviced. excellent service indeed. Thanks ",4
I handed in my retrenchment documents in 2014 and the insurance was supposed to settle my loan but then in 2015 I received a call to pay my loan which I paid till 2020. I then went to the African Bank in Maponya Mall in September 2020 to go query it and they confirmed that the documents that I had submitted are on the system but were never processed. They then processed the documents and confirmed that the loan has been settle by the insurance and that I should expect a refund of all the monies that I had paid. I have been calling and going to both the branches in Maponya Mall and Diepkloof Square but they have been giving me the run around. So can someone from African Bank contact me because I want my money and my money to be cleared!!!!!!!!,1
"I applied for a loan on 11.02.2021, the sales person said that I have been approved. They called me again on 12.01.2021 and ""completed"" my application and said that the loan was approved and that I would receive my loan in 24 hours. This morning (13.01.2021) at 11h00 I was called again to complete my application, I signed a debit order (voice) for the repayment. I even went into the branch to update my contact details as my telephone number did not correspond with what they had on the system. The lady I spoke to last said that I would get the money in 24 - 48 hours. At 14h00 I open African bank website, sign in just to see that my application had been rejected! How can they do this to people? People make loans because they need assistance, the rejection letter states that ""if my circumstances change they will gladly review my application"". SWAK!!!",1
"Goodday,

Each month African Bank rewards me with a voucher for 10 x swipe on my card/ this month i have a issue. They sent me the voucher code and when try to redeem it , Checkers / Shoprite says the voucher is invalid. I have phone your call centre yesterday and was advised that the voucher is valid. Please assist.

"Hi hope you well
My mother passed away last week.

I spoke with them on the landline went twice to the George

The consultant scan the documents to them but no feedback as of now.
It's.  actually sad to think of it in such a difficult situation.

Thanks.

"African Bank is the worst misleading Bank ever. I havea credit card with African bank and i contacted them to settle my account. The consultant said i can settle the account and receive a 20% discount. She gave me an amount and i agreed. They then lodged a debit order taking an amount of over R19000. When i followed up today with 2 consultants that requested an account closure. This could not be done and they said there is an outstanding amount. There are all of a sudden no discount offer and i owe the full amount. Several unsuccessful calling attempts i decided due to African bank providing me with h misleading information and not answering calls i will just reverse the devit order. Everyone has a different story. They are absolutely pathetic and its easy to take the money but after sale service vuce they are useless. I would not advise anyone to open an account  or take out any product with them as they lie about things to get the deal done.

I was willing to settle the acount, but i will only settle once they get their facts straight and come up with a better offer",1
"I have about 4 loans with African bank, some taken out as far back as 2013. Since 2013 my financial position has changed drastically and I have been forced in a sense to make difficult decisions. Although I make payments on my accounts, African bank is not happy with the amounts I pay then they decide to send people out to my workplace. putting me in the spotlight and casting a bad light over me. I have a family that is struggling my sister is a single parent raising two boys and she looks after my other sister and my elderly mother who is ill. I also help her financially through the month and I purchase my moms meds as she does not even get a pension. having said all of this, I myself struggle. my husband has been unemployed since February 2020. and I have this burden to carry. when I ask African bank to provide me with running statements from date of inception of the loans and a printout on how the interest etc is calculated, they cannot provide that. they appoint attorney, who are suppose to know that interest cannot be more than capital amounts owing. they have messed up my credit status. I am unable to get any clothing accounts for my child they have really f***** up my life. I have asked on countless occasions whether one of the many directors can call me to discuss the way I have been treated. the call centre staff unprofessional. due to them and the pressures placed on me, I have suffered from depression.

I don't know why they are even allowed to operate as a banking institution",1
"  I  took a loan with African Bank on 09 September 2012. The initial instalment per month was R4000 & something. In 2013, I requested African Bank to reduce my premium. I was reduced to  R2686.58.  In 2017, I received a bank statement indicating that I owe R135 444.66. Today when I called African Bank was told I owe R152 000 and something. I therefore would like you to assist me that my account be revised and reflect all money paid  and the correct balance from  2013 to date. The account number **********",1

I need statement from African Bank.  They dont want to send it to me because my cellphone number have changed. This is very unfair. They need me to go to the African bank branch for them tp update their records with the new cell number . It is very risky to travel up and down during corona virus just to inform them that my cellphone have changed. My new cell phone number is **********,1
"We have 2 loans with African bank, during lockdown with 2 months no income they required paperwork for insurance to pay. As to date african banks insurance didn't pay the 2 months on premiums and so it states my husband is in arears. Which effects his credit score. Why do u pay for insurance if u cant use it. He was told that the insurance lapsed when the first debit order went ofg. But we still have to pay for it????? Pathetic service from African bank. ",1
"Aftee being sent from pillar to post since Wednesday, my issue still havent been resolved. No one have borhered coming back to me. More than 9 calls have been made to them.

I seriously don't understand why you have to go through all that drama just to redeem your reward if it's so hard for them to manage it why do it imagine you have have to get frustrated first before you can enjoy the benefits of banking with African bank",2

I have raised a query with African Bank on the 18th of dec 2020 and till this day no feedback was received from them regarding my complaint. This Bank takes its customers for granted and no level of respect is there for its customers.

"African bank my world rewards is a complete scam. On the 4th of December I received a SMS stating that I qualified for the rewards because I swiped more than 10 times for the month. I followed the steps within the SMS and got the following SMS:

Congrats! Your R150 Shoprite/Checkers WiCode is **********28. TO REDEEM SHOW THIS SMS TO CASHIER.  For queries ********** or ***********. Ts and Cs apply

Upon going to Shoprite at the counter I was told the WICODE is Invalid! How embarrassing!
I contacted African bank on the number in the sms but no answer, I left a message with my name and number, up till now they still haven't gotten back to me.
I went on the site and filled out the form for a call back, then received a SMS stating that I should rate the service I got from one of their consultants when no one called me at all! I then rated them 0 and told them I haven't received a call from any consultants! I called again today which is a whole 1 month later and the consultant told me that he has escalated the matter.
Probably going to be waiting another month just to know the outcome of that escalation! 
Worst service ever! Scam rewards! 

Received another SMS today saying I qualified for another reward, chose the fees rebate option this time and got a SMS saying within 5 days the money will be in my account. Not even looking forward to it because its probably a scam as usual.  ",1

What a USELESS bank. I went into your Cape Gate branch on the 29th to apply for a credit card. I was helped very swiftly by a gentleman called Gerald. He quickly filled in my application and got a pre-approval. UNFORTUNATELY that is where all customer services ended. It was requested that I send bank statements and payslips with my ID. I did exactly that about 13:00 that same day. I waited all day and got no feedback. I then waited until mid afternoon the next and got no feedback and decided to call. Gerald told me that he will follow up and got back to me saying your head office has my docs and will get an answer soon. I waited all day and got no answer. I called back again and got the same answer. Head office has your docs and they will give us a answer by the end of the day. I then AGAIN called back on the 2nd and even had Gerald let the branch manager escalate my issue to your head office. I was again told I will deff get a answer by today. 16:00 comes and still no answer. I called Gerald AGAIN and this time I told him that if I do not get an answer today you can leave it. He said he'll call the head office and get back to me. He then called me back and told me these words ' THEY SAID IF THEY DO NOT SMS YOU WITH AN ANSWER TODAY THEY WILL JUST LEAVE/ REJECT YOUR APPLICATION. I simply DO NOT believe you are still in business with a mindset like that. To top it off it is now the 3rd of Jan and still no answer or call from anyone just repeated sms from African Bank asking me for my docs which I have sent 5 days ago. I would appreciate if someone from your head office can contact me. I know thats wishful thinking but maybe somewhere there is someone that knows how to do their job.,1

(This is after a month ago apparently they couldn't find biometrics for me at vangate mall however how did I manage to get the existing loan) then, we complete contract and I think everything is fine. I decide to go into the bank yesterday and they told me biometrics must be done but it's not loading (another problem) then the consultant tells me to wait 24hours and I have to come back but I must now bring updated documents (because of all the funny information each and every consultant gives me I must go get documents from scratch and I do not own a printer) I have no way of getting a payslip I emailed it and was told I must physically bring it. I will for the 6th time and 2nd mall 8 calls later now I have to go stand again in a LINE and MOST LIKELY GET TOLD I MUST WAIT.  what is happening????

Everytime I call in they tell me they have to log a refund, I was told this morning a manager would contact me and still nothing.

Its sad how when one owes African Bank money they can call all day, but when African Bank owes the customer money, no contact at all.

Brought my grandfather to the bank to enquire about an email sent. Because of his age and lack of understanding when it comes to technology he had to be accompanied so I could explain the problems as he does not fully complain. Before given a chance to state the issue it before I was even greeted I was told to leave and go stand outside. The clerk refused to hear that my grandad could not provide the information she needed on his own. She continued to be rude and refused to listen to the actual problem. I left to stand a distance away and I could hear how she could not even address the issue he was having. Instead she wasted time telling him information we already had from using the app.,1

He also promised to and did give me a call back the following day to ensure the account was set up and ready for the money to be deposited. 

So I just wanted to let acknowledge the excellent and competent service from your consultant and really appreciated his effort. I hope that he will receive the deserved recognition for his efforts. ",5

The complaint is against the actual bank. They offer a R150 shopping voucher if you swipe 10X. 
The branches who I have been to 4x are unable to assist as it does not come from them. 
You get an sms saying congrats you have been awarded R150 .... but no link. If I email them they tell me to go to nearest branch. So since November I am unable to claim.

Bad bad service!! I settled my credit card in August to date they are still debiting my acc everymonth. I even have a paid up letter but it such an inconvinience for them to take my money every month while i have paid up. Never again will i do business with them,1
Great service from African Bank got my loan approved in less then 24 hours helped me alot to furnish my new place and also they had a seamless process ,5
African bank had been debuting money from my account without my consent. I phoned them trying to raise this.issue and I spoke to a very rude consultant who I them asked to be transferred to the supervisor and her name was Zandile. She was the worst team leader ever. She raised her voice at me. She did not want to understand where I am coming.from and told me how I dont understand how this Debit Order things work. She was so mean . Words cant even Express how angry I was. I later then told her to transfer to someone else as our argument got so heated. She forwarded the call to Ndondaentle. I spoke to him and explained everything. He said they will open a case for me for this issue to be investigated. . To my surprise Today I receive an SMS to say a query has been resolved. No one has phoned me since. No form of communication regarding this was sent to me. So African Bank treats people bad then they don't even so follow ups when a query has been brought up to their attention. ,1

"I was invited open a MyWorld savings account online, which seemed like a good idea at the time. After a few months and some deposits, I went to the bank to get a card so I could access my savings, only to be told my profile is blocked (didn't even know I had one). I was told to go to Home Affairs to verify my biometrics, which I did. 

After more than 5 visits to the branch, long phone calls (total waste of time), no one could reset my online profile, issue me with a card, or grant me access to the deposits. Only after I threatened to involve lawyers and ombudsman did I get limited access to my deposits. Imagine if I had an emergency, I'd be doomed. 

The IT/Technical Team of African Bank is worse than any other bank I have ever used. The entire system should be sc****d, and they must benchmark from other banks. ",1
On the 9/12/2020 at 14.21 p.m. I received an sms from the the African bank stating that the  debit order for December will be deducted on the 11.12.2020 and if I had any questions I was to call them on **********. I didn't have the chance to read my messages at that time as I was busy at work. When I got home after 18.00 p.m. on the same day I saw the message and I made a note to call them the next morning as it was past the normal business trading hours. I called the number mentioned in the sms before 9 a.m. the next day the 10/12/2020 only to be told that the debit order was already processed at midnight. I find this totally unacceptable as I wasn't even given 24 hours to respond and I haven't given any consent for my debit order date to be changed. Further to this I did not get paid on the 11/12/2020 as the bank assumed. All the consultant could do was respond with was that she was sorry. I had to borrow this money to ensure that the debit order went through as I know that the unpaid item would have a negative impact on my credit records. I have been a loyal client who hasn't missed any repayments. Even if there was a need for the early debit surely clients should be notified at least a week in advance.,1

"It is not acceptable that you take your money before I earn it ... This Debicheck mandate thing must change. I signed an agreement that I want the money to go off on the 25th of the month ...

I did not AGREE to you taking my money on 15 December 2020 and also I do not like the face that you did not heed my request to take a payment break in July 2020 when I did not have funds for the debit order to go through ...

Thanks to Tshepo of Daveyton Mall Branch for the service received. I was really worried that no one would be ready to help with the issue that he helped solve.

I have tried to contact the bank via the call centre, the two emails I was given and an 011 number and this has been since Saturday to no avail. I am still waiting to hear something from the bank. They have not even acknowledged the fact that I have contacted them. This is really not acceptable, especially for a bank that has been doing a lot of campaigning lately.

From March 2020 when lock down started to July 2020 I was offered a payment break. At the time I could still cover my instalments so it was not needed. When I need a payment break now they tell me they cannot offer it to me. I have never once skipped a payment with them. My interest rate is 80% of the loan amount I am paying back which i have also asked for this to be looked into and was told that this is what i have signed up for.

I am paying what is due every month, what is the purpose of this man coming to my home??

"This is a review of African Bank's transactional platform, not so much their investment platform. If I had to review their investment offerings I would have probably given a higher review, perhaps a 4.5 out of 5.

So first the good stuff.
This bank being relatively new among the major banks of South Africa seems to be very proactive in providing genuine value by way of investment products which actually give back without taking back what they give by way of high service fees, or by not giving decent returns, as with other banks. This is why I have to take my hat off for African Bank's investment offerings.

The bank however does not fair that well with their transactional platform, the ""My World"" and their ""Pocket"" offerings, in my humble opinion. It appears in fact that they try to take back here what they give to the customer through their very attractive investment returns.

Let me explain.

Technically, African Bank can actually own up to 2.75 percent of funds you deposit into your transactional and pocket accounts, depending on the channel you use to transact.
They do this by charging you up to 2.75 percent of all your funds as service fees, but without applying a sealing limit to their deposit fee.
The implication of this seemingly minor detail is far more serious than the average consumer realizes, and the bank thrives on that ignorance. If customers realized this fact, they would be up in arms.
This fact, the non-adherence to a sealing limit to the deposit fee,  is not known by the average consumer of their products, unless they carefully study the fees structure.

I will now explain this, first by quoting directly from their price guide, and then by demonstrating the implication of that pricing policy. Ready? Here goes.

Let's use the Pay@ Debit card deposit channel which attracts their highest price of 2.75% of your deposit.
Their price guide lists this as follows:

QUOTE:

Pay@ debit card deposits**
2.75% of transaction (Main Account);
2.75% of transaction (Power Pocket);
2.75% of transaction (Savings Account ).

UNQUOTE

Notice as I mentioned, none of these include a maximum sealing limit, so let's see how this seemingly minor omission has a far more serious implication than most of us realize.

Let's say you have a large sum of money to deposit into your debit card: 100,000 Rands.
Well, in that case, your service fee alone will be a wopping 2,750 Rands!
Let's say you are depositing 1 million Rands.
Your service fee alone will be 27,500 Rands!
This is for a single deposit transaction fee!
Can you now appreciate that African Bank has no limit of how much they can charge you for service fees? This is how severe the matter is, when I say they don't have sealing limits to their service fees.

Let's now assume they did have a sealing limit to their deposit fees. The wording in their price guide should then state something like this:

QUOTE:

Pay@ debit card deposits**
2.75% of transaction up to R800 (Main Account);
2.75% of transaction up to R800 (Power Pocket);
2.75% of transaction up to R800 (Savings Account ).

UNQUOTE

Now, let's say you deposited R10,000.
Your service fee would be R275. Fair enough. The sealing limit won't apply because your fees have not reached that limit. The bank still makes their reasonable income from your money.
Now let's say you deposited R50,000. If the sealing limits do not apply (as it currently stands), you will be paying a fee of R1,375.
However, if there is a sealing limit applied to their fees (as it should be within fair and good reason), the service fee will now be limited to R800.
Same thing in our extreme examples above with R100,000 Rands, or even 1,000,000 Rands. With a sealing limit applied, the bank will charge the maximum of R800 for those fees.
They could then earn by investing customer money and earning their living from the returns, since most consumers will choose to put large sums into investment options that the bank can in turn earn from.

Now I'll offer you a good tip for depositing funds with African Bank:

The best option for depositing cash as of the time of this writing and their present price guide in my experience is as follows:
African bank states in their current price guide:
QUOTE:

Pay@ cash deposits**
R5.00 for first R1000 then 1.75% 
of value R1000 is exceeded by.""

UNQUOTE

Let's explain that clearly.
	It means that if you deposit R1,000 or less, whatever the amount, you will pay R5 for that transaction.
So, if you deposit R1, you will pay R5 service fee! If you pay R5, you will pay the whole R5 back as service fee. If you pay R1,000, you will still pay R5 as service fee. Got it?
However, any amount over R1000 that you are depositing will be charged differently. For that additional amount, you will pay 1.75% of the whole amount after R1,000 as fees.
So, if you deposit R3000, you will pay R5 for the first 1,000, and R35 for the remaining 2,000 because R35 is 1.75% of 2,000. Your total fee will be R40.

But here's the trick I want to share with you.

If you be nice to the Pay@ shop teller, buy them a cold drink or something for their time, they might agree to help you by doing multiple transactions of R1,000 for you. This means your fees will be far cheaper.
Remember that R5 is only 0.5% of 1000. So doing it this way means that you will pay only half a percent for the combinations of all your transactions. And yes, it's perfectly legal, unless African bank decides to destroy this option by adjusting their service fees structure against it in the future.

So in the example of our R3,000 that we wanted to deposit earlier, instead of paying the R40 as service fees (which I described earlier), if you make 3 deposits of R1000, then you will only pay R5 for each transaction, so your total fees = R15.
This will evade the 1.75% of the amount of your intended single transaction which was supposed to exceed R1,000.

One final note. Before publishing this review, I contacted the support desk of the bank and proposed my request of applying a sealing limit to their fees, as other banks do. I was contacted by an agent telephonically with the unfortunate feedback that the bank cannot consider my request.
I am hoping that this review might reach an influencial representative at African Bank, who might consider this proposal as reasonable and decide to implement it. Perhaps other customers may wish to chime in with this proposal, improving the likelihood of it being noticed.

I hope this helps everyone out there. Money is tight, and if I can help some of you save, perhaps God will bless me to survive financially also in this difficult world. As a side note, I was retrenched from FNB, having worked there for 10 years, because they don't want people with disabilities in their workforce. I am totally blind in both eyes. All the blind switchboard operators at branches throughout the country working for FNB were targeted and retrenched in May of 2019. We cried and pleeded during the retrenchment hearings, but they never stopped to ask ""How can we help you"".
It's a cruel world. God bless everyone. If you wish to get in touch with me regarding my review, please write me by E-mail. ykhandoo
followed by the @ sign, followed by webmail.co.za. Now put that together using human intelligence so that spam robots don't pick up the address and start sending me garbage E-Mail.
